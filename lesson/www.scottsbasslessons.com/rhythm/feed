<p>Time feel and <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/uncategorized/how-to-create-rb-bass-lines-and-grooves-with-danny-mo-morris.html" target="_blank">groove</a> are a bass players lifeline... if you don't have those elements nailed down then you're going to be in serious trouble!</p>

<p>PS. In two weeks time I'll be releasing one of the most useful and actionable courses I've ever created into the Academy. If you have aspirations of pushing your bass playing to that next level, and in this case working as a semi-pro or pro bass player, then this course is a must - and unfortunately the topic of this course is overlooked and forgotten about my so many bass players. Intrigued? There'll be more info coming soon ;)</p>
<p>PPS. If you enjoy this lesson then you should absolutely check out our time and groove awareness course in the Academy here at SBL. It's over 2 hours long and includes 14 jam packed lessons focusing on time and groove.

<p>===</p>
<h1>Lesson Overview</h1>
<p>You may think that using rhythmical repetition within your lines sounds simple at first, but trust me - I see countless bass players meandering around the fretboard with no real certainty, or solid groove and time feel within their playing. It makes their lines sound weak and ungrounded but I find that much of the time this is simply due to a lack of repeated rhythms being used.</p>
<p>Even the most <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/riff-of-the-week/twister-bass-riff-week-8.html" target="_blank">complex of bass lines</a> will keep returning to some sort of ‘centre’, some sort of rhythmical foundation. This is what creates the groove that as listeners put’s a smile on our face, get’s our feet tapping and our heads bobbing. Much of the time the ‘centre’ I'm talking about will be created by using repeated rhythmical figures within a groove or bass line.</p>
<p>In this lesson I explain the rhythmical grid that “Good Times” by Chic is based upon, and we look into using repetition within your lines to give you a more compositional approach when creating grooves, riffs and <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/danny-mo-morris-r-b-bass-lesson.html" target="_blank">bass lines</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in taking the rhythmical side of your playing to a completely new level you should also check out my “Groove Formula” course within <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy" target="_blank">the Academy</a> here as Scott’s Bass Lessons. In fact the lesson you’re watching right now is taken directly from that course. In a nutshell, it’s the most in-depth course focused around groove and bass line creation ever created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Your Homework</h1>
<p>What are your all time favourite bass lines or riffs?</p>
<p>Is it, or are they, built using some sort of repeated rhythmical pattern?</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments below!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>

<p>
<p>===</p>
<h1>Lesson Overview</h1>
<p>Around 3 months ago I released a program called "The Groove Formula"... it was an 8 week long intensive course in which we were focusing on <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/rythm/make-the-metronome-swing-bass-lesson.html" target="_blank">rhythm</a> and <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/riff-of-the-week/lets-get-funk-bass-riff-week-6.html" target="_blank">groove</a>, and how to really take your bass playing to the next level by focusing on some of the fundamental building blocks you must have in place to really be a great bass player.</p>
<p>Long story short, it was the most popular course I've ever released. Almost a thousand bass players enrolled, and the feedback was phenomenal.</p>
<p>The crazy bit is - the feedback was so good, that many of the students who enrolled within the Groove Formula program started to ask me to add this course into the Academy course library as they found it was such a game changer for their bass playing - it needed to be in there.</p>
<p>Initially I hesitated - but then I began to listen more and more...</p>
<p>So without further a do... I'm over the moon to announce that I've decided to add the full 8 week long Groove Formula program into the Academy course library... in fact, it was added yesterday!</p>
<p>So now when you become an Academy member you get full access to the course library, the weekly live seminars, the lesson workbooks, the play-along library and everything else in there... but now, you also get full access to the groove formula program too!</p>
<p>When I first released the Groove Formula it was $147 to enroll - but now you get it thrown in as part of your Academy membership.</p>
<p>In fact, this lesson is taken directly from the course... I'm discussing "note length", the importance of it, and also giving you some great exercises you can start using immediately to start getting your groove chops together...</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. If you wanna skip this lesson and just enroll in the Academy for the full effect, you can <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/sbl-academy-checkout" target="_blank">grab your 14 day trial here.</a></p>
<p>PPS. I've had heaps of emails regarding the upcoming podcast... don't worry, it's on the way... I'm aiming to release episode 1 in the next 10 days! :)</p>

<p><em>This lesson was taken from the "Essential Groove Techniques" course within the SBL Academy. <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy" target="_blank">Grab your 14 day free trial by clicking here.</a></em></p>
<p>
<h1>Lesson Summary:</h1>
<p>As bass players we’re expected to be <em>hyper</em> tuned in and focused on creating bass lines that either <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/danny-mo-morris-r-b-bass-lesson.html" target="_blank">lock in with the kick drum</a> or are conversational with it. To do this you must <em>always</em> be listening and reacting to whatever drum pattern the drummer is creating at any given time.</p>
<h3>1. Learn how drum patterns are constructed:</h3>
<p>It’s vital that you know how drum patterns are created. The most simplest of drum patterns will have the hi-hats on either the quarter notes or eighth notes throughout each measure, the snare playing the back beats on 2 and 4, and the kick drum playing on 1 and 3 with variations upon that theme. As I said, this is just the simplest of beats. You must know, understand and intuitively recognise all variations of this without thought.</p>
<p>How to you do this?</p>
<p>Listen drummers and study their drum patterns just as much as you study other bass players and bass lines.</p>
<h3>2. Understand that you don’t have to be unconditionally locked in with the kick drum:</h3>
<p>Some songs are going to need you to lock in with the kick drum. Others will have more room for movement, and in those cases you can be more conversational with the kick drum. Ultimately, it depends on what vibe you’re trying to create with your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/using-pedal-points-bass-lesson.html" target="_blank">bass line</a>. When being conversational, you can either play a rhythmical pattern that differs from the kick drum - almost like you’re playing in the gaps, or one of my favourites is to create a bass line that’s more like a melodic motif.</p>
<h3>3. With great power comes great responsibility:</h3>
<p>As bass players we can greatly alter the vibe of any song by using these techniques. Always be mindful of how your chosen bass line is effecting the overall feel of the song.</p>
<p>I love the expression <em>“play for the song”</em>… in other words, play what’s <em>right</em> for the song, not what’s right for <em>you</em>.</p>
<h1>Your Homework:</h1>
<p>In the comments below i’d love you to let me know what your biggest challenge is when playing with drummers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1.</strong> Do you find it easy to lock in with the kick drum?<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Is this a new concept to you and is something you haven’t really thought of before?<br />
<strong>3.</strong> If these techniques are something you’ve been well aware of for a while, what are your favourite examples of bass players playing with the kick drum or being conversational with it?</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<p>When I tell people you can make a metronome actually ‘swing’ I get some funny looks to say the least…</p>
<p>But, you certainly can make it <em>swing</em>!</p>
<p>A metronome can be an invaluable tool for bass players that are seeking to develop their groove and time feel. The key, is to find ways of using the metronome in a <em>musical way</em> that re-enforces your internal subdivision feel and in turn develops your overall groove.</p>
<p>In the past few lessons we’ve focused on getting your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/rythm/shuffle-bass-lesson.html" target="_blank">shuffle feel</a> together and strengthening your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/rythm/bass-groove-lesson.html" target="_blank">eighth note grooves</a>. In this lesson you’re going to learn how to make the metronome swing.</p>
<p>We’re going to start off slowly, so if you’re just starting out playing swing - this lesson will be great for you.</p>
<p>If you’re a more advanced player, don’t worry - I’ve included some exercises in this lesson that are going to make you <em>sweat</em>! ;)</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<p>BB King, Eric Clapton, Steely Dan, Boz Scaggs, Jimi Hendrix, even The Roots have all used the shuffle feel...</p>
<p>It's one of the most important and popular feels in music today - and therefore, it's absolutely vital that we have this feel completely mastered!</p>
<p>The shuffle feel is also very flexible in its application. There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npRh8JassTk" target="_blank">traditional</a> shuffle feels, right through to the <a href="https://youtu.be/9t0VlzJeNvA?t=1m27s" target="_blank">Purdie Shuffle</a>, and everything in-between.</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to show you 2 great exercises to help you start fine tuning your shuffle!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<p>Great rhythm is absolutely vital to us as bass players and musicians. It's the one fundamental factor of everything we play.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you can <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/beginners/slap-bass-getting-started.html">slap</a> a thousand notes a minute. It doesn't matter if you can <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/play-multiple-octave-scales-like-bad-ass.html">solo</a> around a complex <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/how-to-play-out-when-soloing-on-bass.html">jazz</a> tune at 300bpm.</p>
<p>It ALL comes down to rhythm. And if you your rhythmical internalisation is off - <em>everything</em> you play will be off.</p>
<p>Now, many people believe that great rhythmical sensibility is something you're born with and that it can't be learned and developed. Well, I say that's absolute rubbish!</p>
<p>Rhythm can be developed. <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/danny-mo-morris-r-b-bass-lesson.html">Groove</a> can be developed. And, your overall sense of time can be developed.</p>
<p>Just like when learning any skill - you just need to be given the right <em>information</em>, at the right <em>time</em>, and then <em>apply it</em>.</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to show you a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/using-pedal-points-bass-lesson.html">great groove</a> exercise to strengthen your rhythmical internalisation.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The bass guitar is as much a rhythmical instrument as it is a harmonic instrument. This is why we must view the study of rhythm itself as being of equal importance as the study of harmony (scales, chord tones etc).</p>
<p>Unfortunately this is often forgotten, and students spend 99% of their time working on harmonic exercises such as scales, arpeggios and such.</p>
<p>I'm sure you can relate to this feeling… 'If I can learn just one more scale!'… 'If I could only play that bit faster!'… this is what I call 'chasing your tail'. You'll always want to play faster, you'll always want one more scale!</p>
<p>It is important to understand that rhythm and harmony are the pillars of all music. Therefore, when you study them separately, and then bring them together, your bass playing will sound infinitely more mature and… BAD ASS! ;)</p>
<p>Now grab your bass and get in the shed!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When playing <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/walking-bass-lines/walking-bass-beginner-2.html">walking bass lines</a>, your feel is absolutely key to make everything 'sit' as it should within the context of whichever ensemble you're playing. The exercises presented within this lesson should help you on your way to strengthening your internal clock and improving your walking bass swing feel.</p>
<p>Whether you've already watched my other <a title="Walking Bass Series" href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/walking-bass-lines/walking-bass-beginner-1.html">lessons on walking bass</a> or not, this one is very important: you can play all the 'right' notes, simple or more sophisticated walking bass lines, if your swing feel isn't good enough, it's gonna sound like... well, it won't sound as good as it should. ;)</p>
