		<description><![CDATA[Being a self taught guitarist and now bass player, my timing has suffered greatly! Now that I am actually beginning to study music and the instrument, I struggle mightily with keeping time. My &#039;live&#039; bass teacher doesn&#039;t let me practice without the metronome...and I&#039;m really glad he forces it. I struggle, but im starting to get it (albeit slowly). As always, a great lesson from Scott! Thanks man! ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great excersise!  I use this one  too, i also use it in 16the note feel, the click will be the last 16th of each count, and then half it to 2 and 4, really great to get your funky stuff happening and you immediately feel where you are rushing, if you do. Keep groovin&#039; :-)]]></description>
