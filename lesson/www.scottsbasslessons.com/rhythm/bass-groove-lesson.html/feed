		<description><![CDATA[Yes I sit and play 4 hours a day ,  I just adjusted the truss rod and adjusted my bridge , pulling the saddles back raise the strings now my bass is much easier to play. Plus I bought head phones so I can slap and pop , the lady below me is a pain in the butt .]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes that&#039;s how I practice sitting upright in a special chair , for some reason while practicing bass the chronic pain seems to not be as bad ,but I cant practice for more than 30 minutes without having to stand and walk for a while then sit back down and continue. People don&#039;t understand how chronic pain changes ones life, I have to work around it constantly.
That&#039;s why I cant play in a band I cant sit for more than 30 minutes then I have to move my body and cervical spine around , the disc have collapsed on to each other. I had a roll over car accident when I was 28 the roof collapsed down on top of my head ,next month I will be 59.
But trusting in a higher power has gotten me thru till today .
I will be okay ,always am.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I seriously doubt I will be able to play in a band ,too much chronic pain in my cervical spine ,cant use a guitar strap .The disc are degenerated , playing bass serves as a way to deal with my chronic pain of 20 years , its terrible and I&#039;m sick  of the constant pain. It just woke me up at 1 am in the morning , cant sleep anymore , wish it would just go away or me spiritually graduate to the place where there is no no pain..I&#039;ve hung in there long enough. But it seems life carries on , I could never hurt my dear mom by taking my own life , she is too dear to me at 81 .]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I watched Kurt Cobain - Montage of Heck on HBO last night , Kurt reminded of a friend that got hooked on heroin after his first fix , seems what they had in common is if they felt too much . Kurt was genius with his music but it seemed dark from his emotions . He had exceptional creative ability that got him  recognition worldwide only to have his life cut short at 27 , its a shame. Thing is I can understand why he had these type feelings , when young I too was seen as different and not accepted  , like I didn&#039;t fit in with the teens my age not understood or misunderstood . I turned to weed to get accepted as part of the crowd around me but when I saw the other drugs come out it scared me , I knew I would die if I tried stronger drugs other than weed.
This is the only reason I&#039;m alive today, my dear mama told me , that&#039;s not the way to have fun son.]]></description>
