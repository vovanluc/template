		<description><![CDATA[split them up in eights first : The capital AND is right in the middle, it&#039;s a plain eight note if you look at it first this way. 


/1 and 2 AND 3 and/  
/1 and 2 and 3 AND 4 and 5 and /
 /1 and 2 and 3 and 4 AND 5 and 6 and 7 and/
 /1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 AND 6 and 7 and 8 and 9 and/  


First set the click to 5 or 7 or 9 beats and then you play the 1 and the AND this creates awareness and learns you to hear it and recognize the pattern! then set the click to the 1 and the AND and play the rythms . I came across this when I was writing some rhythmic stuff once and I made it an excersise. 


Have Fun! :-]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott and Hlinton

that&#039;s exactly how I learned to play odd time stuff! When I had been playing about 2 years (and didn&#039;t read music or know a semiquaver from a hole in the wall) I started playing in a band with a great drummer who would write all these crazy fusion-y rhythms and the only way I could get my head around it was to sing the phrases to myself like the way Scott said: find words with the same amount of syllables as the beat groupings. It worked surprisingly well! It seems like an simple version of that Carnatic counting thing that a lot of fusion players use, which looks pretty good for counting odd (as well as even) subdivisions. Recently found this video where Jonas Hellborg talks about it a bit http://www.musikmachen.de/Workshops/Bass-Videoworkshop-Odd-Time-Signatures]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know how to count sub-divisions for whole, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, &#038; 1/16 but not for 5 or 6 notes/beat. Is there a &quot;proper&quot; way to count them and, if so, what are they? Also, it would be great to learn to properly count &#038; play quarter note triplets. Thanks.
Cheers,

		<description><![CDATA[This is a sweet lesson.. I think the Cmaj chord in the background is gonna give me nightmares though... The more you listen to it, the scarier it becomes.. 
I remember you had a lesson with similar content where you switched between 16th and triplets... It was crazy how it sounded together.. Nice videos. (:]]></description>
