		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott. I´m triyng to find new &quot;colours&quot; when i improvise. I´m really upset whit the blues scale and the modes of the Mayor Scale. Maybe the minor melodic scale can help me, specially the superlocrian mode and the lydian dominant mode. However, is a little dificult to use it. 

PD: This topic has nothing to do with the lesson. Sorry

Greetings from Chile.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I understood that the bass and the drums must be united I thought the best way to do it right was playing along with the kick. It&#039;s the best way to make the &quot;perfect bass-line&quot;. But the lesson has showed me how to use it right and making a cool groove. I enjoyed a lot the lesson! 

Ps: How can I play all these scales with your fluency? There are special exercises to play scales all over the neck without thinkin&#039;?

Thanks!]]></description>
