The first electric bass guitar was invented (according to Wikipedia) by Paul Tutmarc in Seattle, Washington and first sold in 1935.  Leo Fender introduced the Precision Bass in 1951.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott - I have a two P-basses (a 62 Jap re-issiue and a US Deluxe) they are both beauties!
I  also have a heavy relic jazz but was reliced by a guy called Alan Knight.  Check him out he is emmensley good at making wood look old!!!!  And on charges a minimum fee!

Can you tell me what lesson deals with putting in the quick chord inflictions you have in this bass line?
Whenever I try stuff like that it just doesnt sound right !!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome as always :-) I love gear and hearing about what people use, but I&#039;m a big believer that the bass player has the groove and sound in his/her fingers and soul.
Thats why I agree, Scott you could get good tone out of a broom shank!!!
I play a Jazz (recent purchase) and an Ibanez soundgear 5 string with MEC pickups on it - its old from 1992, but its my baby!

Thanks again man - you and your playing have fired up my love for music and playing again! Hoooorah!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two worthwhile points about the P bass...everyone is complimenting the tone. You say Leo got it right the first time around...
1. The P bass goes directly into the board better than just about any bass out there...always has. Even a weak engineer can get a good sound (I&#039;ve dealt with one or two...just give &#039;em a P-bass straight in and they&#039;re geniuses.) :-)
2. The name comes from the fact that it has a fretted neck....for the first time, bassists didn&#039;t have to &quot;struggle&quot; so much with intonation (although any real player will tell you there&#039;s a lot more than just pressing the string at the right fret....tone is in the fingers!).
   Love it all, Scott....could not recommend a bass teacher any more highly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[the finish of this model is really ugly ... but this bass seems to sound really good. I&#039;m definitly addicted to P-basses (I myself play mainly a Fender Precision H1), it&#039;s a joy to hear one so well played. keep on grooving, Scott !]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First off: I agree with you regarding the way a P-bass sits in the mix. I love the sound of a Jazz but its just so cliche these days - everybody sounds the same to my ear. That and I was listening to Orgone for a long while and just couldn&#039;t get that 70&#039;s funk out of my ears. Problem with a P though is the crazy wide neck. I played one for 11 years before picking up a Jazz and I never looked back. So, what to do? Have one made to my specs: http://bit.ly/zveB87 If you check out the link I also addressed this &quot;relic madness&quot; by for-going any sort of paint at all. Pure. Raw. Wood. There&#039;s nothing better IMHO. Twice a year I apply some Tru-Oil to the neck with some 0000 steel wool [just like they tell you to do if you own a Musicman] and top it off with some Feed &#039;N Wax. It sounds great. It plays great. It feels great. Every thing you&#039;d want in a bass. All this for less than $1000!!! Cheers...]]></description>
