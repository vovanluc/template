		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m really interested in the acoustic sound of the bass. They appear to have put a lot of thought and technology into that. The purple looks less bad the more times I look at it. Go to the web site, in all black the bass looks amazing.
For faculty Tony Franklin would be awesome.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, Deep! But Purple... That&#039;s OK, I love the concept, as I&#039;m a beginner bass player and I&#039;d like to practice when I&#039;m away from home.
It would be tremendously great if you could convince Andy Rourke (The Smiths) and Simon Gallup (The Cure) to teach us a few tricks.
Gotta continue my &quot;Module 4 - Adding Scales to your Grooves&quot; lesson now. Cheers! Chris.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I play a Jazz bass which is quite heavy and even though I don&#039;t travel much anymore this lighter &quot;Journey&quot; bass would be great to take to practices. And it would be nice to carry with me when I visit my musician friends just in case an impromptu jam session breaks out ! My early influences were Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn, James Jamerson, and Ron Carter but I would really like to see Leland Sklar do an interview and lesson on SBL. Thanks for all you do Scott !]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Would love to see Nathan East do a lesson on SBL - probably the most underrated bass virtuoso of our time and yet with the distinction of jamming on more than 2,000 recordings (most in music history) in just about every genre (rock, jazz, R’n’B, etc) backing just about every platinum recording artist you could imagine…….and the dude can sing as well ! 
I would love to hear the inspiration for his chromatic lick on that Michael McDonald jam......BTW, purple is my wife’s favourite colour, so she may just give in to yet another bass guitar in the house !]]></description>
