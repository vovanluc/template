		<description><![CDATA[Jeff, you sound like me.  I also grew up playing sax so my sight reading for treble clef is very good but I have to think about quick recognition with bass clef although it&#039;s getting a bit easier.  I am trying to memorize patterns on my fretboard which I know in time will always give me a launch point from where I am centered.  Almost sounds like that didn&#039;t make sense but I think you know what I mean.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hey scott.

you didn&#039;t mention what bass you play? i guess the instrument might be considered a part of your gear, and an important one too.
you made a video about you fender custom bass, but i&#039;m interested in the one you&#039;ve been playing in your lessons (which are very helpfull and entertainig). what wood, pickups etc. it is...

thank you!
keep going

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, what are your feelings on the Line 6 gear? I&#039;m not a tone-head, but I love the ease of use of just one footswitch and done instead of many pedals. Do you find these are more reliable, or sound better? -Just curious on your opinion. Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott.  You really demonstrate lessons and ideas in a great comprehensive way.  I have to tell you though, that I have discovered a new drinking game using this vid.  Everytime you say &quot;pedal board video&quot; you have to take a shot.  Dont drive anywhere after..

Otherwise..please keep posting vids.  I am a veteran learning all sorts of great things as well as cleaning up some of my own poor techinique.

Thanks...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jeff glad you&#039;re enjoying the lessons! You should basically be trying to learn everything you talked about lol... I know, that&#039;s not much help is it! ;)... what I would say is, try breaking it into bite size chunks... so your basically not trying to do everything at once... as in... trying to sprint up everest! ;) The Play Among Series are based at beginner and intermediate players I guess but there plenty for everyone in there! Have a great day man. Scott.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[SCOTT, JUST FOUND YOUR WEBSITE AND I AM VERY GLAD TO HAVE YOUR LESSONS TO HELP ME MOVE ALONG WITH MY BASS PLAYING. I AM A 53 YEAR OLD WHO TOOK UP BASS BECAUSE OUR WORSHIP TEAM HAD NO BASS PLAYER AND I KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING BASS AND DRUMS TO HOLD THE GROOVE TOGETHER. MY PREVIOUS MUSIC EXPERIENCE IS HAVING PLAYED SAXOPHONE SINCE THE AGE OF 12 OR SO. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE TREBLE CLEF BUT VERY LITTLE ABOUT BASS CLEF. I AM GETTING TIRED OF PLAYING ROOT NOTES TO THE SONGS AND LOOK TO UP MY GAME A LITTLE AND WAS WONDERING WHAT EXCERCISES YOU RECOMMEND FOR BEGINNERS.( UNDER TWO YEARS EXPERIENCE) I FEEL LIKE I HAVE PRETTY GOOD RYTHYM WITH MY BASS PLAYING, BUT STILL STRUGGLE WITH RECOGNIZING NOTES ON THE FRETBOARD. SHOULD I BE FOCUSING ON LEARNING THE FRETBOARD, OR THE PATTERNS AND SHAPES THAT YOU TALK ABOUT IN YOUR LESSONS? ALSO, ARE YOUR DVD LESSONS GEARED TOWARD PROFESSIONALS OR BEGINNERS?(OR BOTH?) THANKS FOR YOUR SITE AND KNOWLEDGE.]]></description>
