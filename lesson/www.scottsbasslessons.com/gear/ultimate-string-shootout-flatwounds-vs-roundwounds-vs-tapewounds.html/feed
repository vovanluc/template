		<description><![CDATA[After the video i had my visit to the luthier and took the chance for Black Wounds on a Bubinga Jazz Bass.
i normally go for round and bright strings but for some reason that i can´t explain (really) i love the feeling of the black wounds on this particular bass
i thing bubinga wood gives a special character to the sound. 
i usually play funk and rock with other basses like warwick,yamaha and peavey B quad Brian Bromberg, but now this BLACK wounds just opened a new world of sounds to play with to me, sort of a more grounded, clean and naked sound. 
can a sound be naked? :)))]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I vote you stick with the round wounds, definitely more your sound, but further, could be my speakers but I sense a thinness of frequency band on the tape wounds, lacking both in the low end and the metallic ring in the high end. They surely have a unique sound, and maybe would be improved with a heavier gauge. Flats have their place, but I feel like you can get pretty close to flats playing rounds with the tone way down playing just the neck pickup, giving you the best of both worlds.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love the video. Listening on laptop speakers I noticed the flat wounds have a double bass vibe to them, even with the tone wide open. The tape wounds have the same, but with the tone off. I&#039;ve used round wounds so far and they have a certain amount of fingernoise which, I think, is probably less with the flat- and tapewound. I know there are guitar strings that are actually roundwounds, but the outside is sanded/grinded????? how you call it, so the become semi-flatwounds. (example: http://www.daddario.com/DADProductsAcoustic.Page?ActiveID=1904 ) The&#039;ve got them in bass strings as well: http://www.daddario.com/DADProductsBass.Page?ActiveID=1905]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK - I&#039;m slack ......... or just maybe the best strings EVER are .......... RotoSound Piano wound.
I bought a new set recently &quot;in case I need them&quot; my first set - still playing since 1982 (no - that is not a typo).
Caviat - used my a little old man - only ever played in church ;)
OK - I haven&#039;t always been old - and I like rock and metal.
These things are still as bright as I ever need and sustain and consistency is never challenged.
Round wound - only the core goes over the bridge - makes for great action and sustain like I said.
Down side - not cheap
Up side - seem to last forever.]]></description>
