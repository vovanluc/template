		<description><![CDATA[The sound I heard on this video was just like when I had to use a very old Sears Bass amp from the 1960s.  It was very unique in that it powered the Tubes/Valves to their maximum power and saturated the dual output transformers very fast so it was extremely easy to get suboctave and distortion at the same time. Those were the days.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, greatings from Portugal

Here comes my doubt hahaha... I have a Line6 effect processor, the Bass Pod XT... And it isn&#039;t possible to put distorcion and octaver at the same time, or octaver and auto-wha (cause for me that really sounds synthy as well)... My question is: what other effects would you recomend using for synthy sounds? &#039;Cause although I usually play with rock bands, I want to incorporate a more comtemporary edge to it.

Thanks in advance mate, I really dig your stuff]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In my opinion, Sadowsky basses are just greatly overrated and more like &quot;I have it, because I can&quot;. :-) Talking about pedals, you can look at Behringer. They are fairly nice for the price they are offered. At the end it all boils down going to the shop with your bass and just trying them out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, obviously you play with high end price bass equipment, and I know it would effect the low-end price bass equipment a little bit. If you do know, what is the difference is sound quality between high and low priced equipment?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I use the octave pedal it adds in a lot more of the low end - but if there&#039;s any issues with the frequencies through the pa the engineer can always work his magic. In all honesty I don&#039;t have many issues like that at all. Thanks for coming along and hanging out man! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good advise and cool lick.  I have an OC-3 that has distortion built in with a level control.  Might have to try that.  I love using an octaver for Stevie and hip-hop in general, as well as emulating a low B string.  I would have thought one of your go-to pedals would have been a compressor.]]></description>
