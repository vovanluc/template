		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, and thanks 4 your inspiring lessons. I`m now a born-again bass enthusiast.

Now, i want your advice. Saddly i havent got Stanley Clarke or your longscale fingers:) That means it can be kind a tricky to get the most out of the left hand on my fender amc. st. jazzb. 

I`m concidering a replica of Geddy Lee, japanese made. It is supposed to have a thinner neck. Supposedly, i can also use  my left hand thumb more effective, since the fretboard is skinnier? I hope you have some good idea, and you may as well recommend a bass guitar, please.

By the way, i am interested in buying Vanderclay neolight cabinets. What cabinets do you use? I noticed you got two neo-light ones. 

On before hand, thanks, and keep up the low-end spirit here. Rgds. Inge Rese]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the vid, I agree about the relationship between wood and tone.  I was wondering about the scale length of that bass, seems to be a bit less than 34&quot; (33&quot; or 32&quot; perhaps?) as well as the position of the pickups seem to be different than a standard jazz in that the neck pickup seems to be placed closer to the bridge in what I&#039;ve seen called the &quot;sweet spot&quot; position.  In any case, looks like it is an effortless bass to play.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey there, Scott! 
Very nice video, thank you. I know there&#039;s a lot of arguing wether the wood influences the tone of an electric instrument or not, but I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that I&#039;m really into heavy woods. I like the feel and tone of it. Warm and strong in the lower midrange. That way you get a deep and heavy tone without the &quot;booming&quot; and &quot;rumbling&quot; if you know what I mean. 
Also I choose humbuckers over singlecoils. I don&#039;t really know why, but I&#039;ve always loved the Gibson SG guitars and EB&#039;s and they come with humbuckers for a reason :) 

All the best, love you, man.

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, the wood species is about the least component of the overall tone of an electric instrument. The construction and electronics principally the pickups are the key to the tone. The wood is not so much about species but grain structure and density. Some luthiers will give a percentage of each ingredient in regards to what influences the final tone, however there is nothing empirical. Listen Geddy Lee in the early 80s where on a few albums he played both a 70s Jazz and a Rick 4001.........not even the best ears can tell the difference. It&#039;s a complex place to go, and too many myths attached to get bogged down into.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, 
You perhaps speak somewhere else about strings you use, especially gauges. 
Can you give again us this information who can significantly influence the playability of the instrument.
Thanks.]]></description>
