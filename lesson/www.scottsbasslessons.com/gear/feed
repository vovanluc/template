				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Traveling with a bass can be a nightmare.</p>
<p>I know this because <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-tips/10-essential-tips-for-flying-with-your-bass.html">I've done it a thousand times.</a> I've lost basses, had cases dropped, crushed and everything in-between...</p>
<p>That's why, when a friend told me about a cool new travel bass that you can take to bits in less than a minute and literally wear it on your back in a small rucksack - <strong>I was REALLY intrigued!</strong></p>
<p>Long story short... I got my hands on one of these basses and thought it'd be fun to show you guys how it all works... And wait till you see how the neck comes off - it's suuuuper cool!</p>
<p>Ohhh... and, just to make the video a bit more fun... <strong>I'm giving away this bass and you can win it!</strong></p>
<p>So....check out this crazy travel bass and how to enter in the video below.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok... I'm going to put YOU to the test.</p>
<p>You up for it?</p>
<p>Plus - I'm also going to reveal the winners of the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/gear/7-basses-just-arrived-post-im-giving-away.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sire bass competition</a>... yep... I'm giving away more than one.</p>
<p>But before we get to that...</p>
<p>In this video, I'm putting a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-tips/jazz-bass-vs-p-bass-thing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jazz bass</a> up against a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/gear/the-p-bass-of-doom.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Precision bass</a>... and I want you to guess which one is which...</p>
<p>BUT... there's a twist! I'm putting a P bass up against a Jazz bass neck pickup!</p>
<p>There has always been a LOT of discussion about whether you can get a P bass vibe with a Jazz bass neck pickup... so, I thought I'd put this to the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/gear/ultimate-string-shootout-flatwounds-vs-roundwounds-vs-tapewounds.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ULTIMATE test</a> and see if you can tell the difference without seeing the basses!</p>
<p>Ready? Let's do this...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey fellow Groovehacker, Scott here...</p>
<p>To say I was a <em>MASSIVE</em> Prince fan would have honestly been an understatement…</p>
<p>In my opinion he was one of the most talented musicians the world has ever seen.</p>
<p>Bass, guitar, keys, drums… he played them ALL (extremely well!) and to top it off his vocal skills were second to none and he could write hit songs like they were going out of fashion ;)</p>
<p>So, yeah.. I was a <em>BIG</em> fan.</p>
<p>You can only imagine how excited I was when I was invited to actually play the last bass Prince ever ordered!</p>
<p>The really sad part of this story is that Prince never received the bass, as he passed away shortly after it had been commissioned, but trust me, he would have <em>LOVED</em> it!</p>
<p>In this brand new video I travel to the Gus Guitars workshop to meet Simon Farmer, the luthier tasked with building Prince's last bass, and find out more about the story behind the instrument (and put the bass through it’s paces!)</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<p>Ok, we all dream about expensive, suuuper sexy basses, right? I know I do... Probably WAY too much ;)</p>
<p>With this in mind, I thought it'd be fun to see if you can tell the difference between a $499 Jazz bass and a $3499 Jazz bass...</p>
<p>I think it'll be harder than you think! ;) So... are you ready for this challenge?!</p>
<p>Good luck, and make sure you comment below the video <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BEFORE</strong></span> you see the results... and then after your initial guess, comment again and let me know whether your guess was right... or wrong!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

<p>Ok... let's talk bass strings!</p>
<p>In this video I’m comparing 3 different types of bass strings…</p>
<p>Roundwounds vs Flatwounds vs Tapewounds.</p>
<p>i.e. <em>the ultimate string shootout!</em> ;)</p>
<p>I figured it’d be fun to film a video for you so you can hear them in comparison with each - and most importantly, on the same bass.</p>
<p>Once you watch the video where you can hear in comparison to each other… make sure to leave a comment below the video and let me know which one YOU preferred.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>So I’ve just got a brand new bass… a beautiful axe from the guys over at Moollon.</p>
<p>... whoop - I LOVE new bass days ;)</p>
<p>So, I thought it’d be fun to film a video where I put it up against my Fender Nate Mendal P bass…</p>
<p>In a nutshell - a P bass shootout!</p>
<p>The Fender is worth $900… and the Moollon is worth $2400… but, can you guess which one wins?!</p>
<p>And, once you’ve watched it - let me know which bass you prefer the tone of in the comments under the video, and why!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<p>In this video I’m going to show you a new effects pedal I’ve just bought that’s been blowing my mind…</p>
<p>I’ve been having so much fun using it within my practice time that I wanted to show you how I’ve been using it - and more importantly WHY I’ve been using it.</p>
<p>I should also say, I’m totally un-affiliated with the company who make this pedal… so there’s no weird motives for me to make this video… the pedal’s just been rocking my world so much I wanted to share it with you guys :)</p>
<p>As always, I’d love to hear from you too… What pedals are rocking your world at the moment?! Lemme know what and why in the comments below the video…</p>
<p>See you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>So, a Kala-U bass… I’ve been wanting to get my hands on one of these for SO long.</p>
<p>After watching so many fantastic players over the last few years get such a great tone out of them, when my wife asked me for some Christmas present hints of what i’d like Santa Claus to bring me - I had one thing in mind…</p>
<p>… a Kala U-Bass!</p>
<p>Luckily, my wife and Santa came up with the goods this year and on Christmas morning I had a beautiful little Kala U-Bass waiting for me under the Christmas tree.</p>
<p>Now, I should say at this point - after about 4 hours of me playing the thing constantly since the unwrapping took place (through everyone else opening their presents - oops) and essentially forgetting that Christmas was actually taking place… I think my wife was regretting the idea, lol… but, that’s a whole different story!</p>
<p>Anyway, what were we talking about?… oh yeah, the U-Bass.</p>
<p>Ok, so I thought i’d film a short review type of vid… not that it’s really a review, but more of my first thoughts, and a little issue I discovered that happens when you slide into a note that might help you out f you buy one of these basses in the future.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy it.</p>
<p>If you do, check out some of my other lessons - you might like those too! ;)</p>
