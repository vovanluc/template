		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott,
I like the White Jazz the best, it just seems to have that special tone for whatever reason.  However, that fret less is super sweet with the fret markers too - I haven&#039;t seen that before on a fret less bass.  Anyway, thank you so much for what you all do at SBL.  I&#039;ve been playing for 30 years in a steady band (with the same guys)!  You have made a huge impact on me as a musician.  I am from a small town in East Tennessee and it would be next to impossible to get instruction like SBL without you.  Thanks!]]></description>

Scott: I have been a member of SBL Academy for quite awhile now and I love it. I have been a professional giggling bass player for 50 years (!) and I still find great new ideas and lessons every time I tune in. 
I&#039;m a Fender man so I love the look and sound of all of them but I will say that I am partial to the PJ although I wouldn&#039;t be disappointed with the Sunburst Jazz. Please send either one my way. 
Keep up the great videos. I love it.]]></description>

Hi Scott. I&#039;ve ben a member of SBL for a few years and it&#039;s an incredible channel. You&#039;re doing great work; keep it up. Anyway to these basses. 

They all look and sound amazing and you couldn&#039;t be disappointed with any of them. I think the maple 5 string looks incredible. I think for sound the white Jazz bass hits my ticket. I&#039;ve been playing Bass a couple of years and my trusty Yamaha RBX has served me well as a beginner instrument but the time is probably right to step up and I think one of these instruments would spur me on to the next level.

Anyway here&#039;s hoping. See you in the shed!

		<description><![CDATA[Hola Scott, you continue to bring it, and I have only been paying attention for a few weeks. I wish I had some great story to get you jazzed up for sending a #sirebass my way, just appreciate you introducing them to me, folks. The 5 string - M7 in the burst sure looks and sounds well worthy - hell they all do. Either way, they are squarely on my radar for additions.

Back to my beginner lessons with you at SBL.

Hello Scott...I&#039;ve been enjoying getting familiar with your youtube channel and website. I am not a bassist yet and have just now decided to join the ranks of bass players and get started on my learning journey. I am however, out of work at present (which is what allows me the time to get started playing) and could benefit greatly by being chosen to receive one of the Sire basses as my very first instrument. I can then sign up for the academy and commence learning to create the elegant music I hear from you and your guests and mentors.
As far as choices go it seems a little strange to be particular but do like the the natural wood v7 that looks like your Overwater and also the black body v7 vintage. But frankly I would be over the moon with any of them.
Thanks for the consideration!

		<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to check in on this again.  I am one of your SBL students from Michigan USA...  I just love that five string beautiful #sirebass and would love to have my name entered into the bass give away for that one.  My second choice would be the Black Vintage #sireBass.  I have never tried one but when I go to Guitar Center I will check them out.  I have just the Squire Beginning bass with the reduced sized neck.   I can tell the #sirebass  sounds much much better and I really want one in the future!]]></description>

Hello Scott,

I&#039;ve been studying your youtube videos for a couple years and finally decided to check out the 14 day free trail to your website (which I am loving and am trying my best to scrap together the money for the year subscription) and just so happened to come across this offer.

I&#039;ve been wanting the Sire M7 5 string since Sire first announced their line of basses. I have been working day in and day out (as I&#039;m sure most musicians here have) to make it as a gigging bassist. For the past 10 years I have relied on a Fender USA J Bass (4string) that has never let me down. I have recently discovered that the action from about 10th fret and above is ridiculously high and any attempt by multiple techs to adjust it just results in fret buzz everywhere else on the bass. I figured if I have played it for this long with high action what difference does it make. I knew eventually I would need an upgrade of some sorts and figured might as well get a good 5 string while I&#039;m at it, hence wanting the Sire, the best bang for your buck you can find. 

So obviously that flame maple Sire M7 is my first pick (also red is my favorite color)

My 2nd pick would be the black vintage V7 (as a replacement for my current J bass)

My 3rd pick would be the PJ to have access to a different tone on a 4 string.

Thanks for this video and for giving all us bassists a chance at winning one of these amazing looking basses!]]></description>

Hey Scott, i only recently started watching your videos but so far I 
just love them. You are not a very conventional music teacher but you 
know whats important about music and thats the key component of good 
teaching, so thank you :D. I started learning Piano 7 years ago stopped for a year picked
 it up again and I am at a kind of good point with that, but about 1.5 
years ago when I stopped playing Piano regularly I started picking up 
string Instruments like the Ukulele, and soon started playing a 
looooooot on the bass of my  older brother but he moved out 6 months ago
 and I rarely get to play on his bass. My mother wont buy me a bass 
because she wants me to focus on playing piano. I cant afford a bass and an amp 
because I just finfished school and cant work during summer because I 
want to concentrate on learning bass, if I wont get a bass from anywhere
 i will probably need to work a month or two in which i could have 
already started learning. But the real reason I am kind of in a hurry 
with getting started is because my best friend and I, with whom I play  piano and sing
most of the time, met a girl with a beatiful voice. We three talked for 
weeks now that we should absolutely try making our own music but at the 
moment I and my friend both play on the Piano, me in the lower parts and 
he in the higher octaves, we all sing but we came across the problem 
that the Piano is wayyyy to prominent in the sound of the whole song, it
 just snatches the attention because its so much at once on one kind of 
an Instrument, also we all love music with string bass lines. We thought
 about putting our money together but my best friend is pretty poor and 
the girl studies acting so I wouldnt like them paying for my Instrument I
 would defenitely work for it if I cant get a bass otherwise. But I see 
some connection of fate or something like that, between that which 
happened a month ago and now: you giving away 7 top notch basses. I 
would reaaaally love to get one of these, my two top choices would be 
the PJ-Bass or the black Vintage bass which both sound amazing and 
unique.
I really enjoy what you are doing and wish you have all the luck you can
 have on your further journey.

Best Wishes from Austria

George]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[#SireBass. Best looking and Sounding definitely has to be the Black V7 Vintage. IT has everything i love in a J bass. First its black on black with a maple neck and Black blocked neck, 70s pickup spacing and did i mention its black on black with maple? I live in very very cold Canada with all the snow and cold, i need a black bass to absorb the suns warmth and keep me warm all winter, Its a matter of survival!]]></description>

The natural finish on the fretless looks beautiful! It also sounds gorgeous with the flatwounds, deep and sexy! I&#039;ve been fretting too much and for too long with my bass playing, which is why you should send me the fretless! (And also because you&#039;re a thoroughly nice chap ;-) )

good evening from overseas - Germany :) 
Thank you Scott for this great give away opportunity! It is simply amazing - also thanks to the guys frome Sirebass.
I really enjoyed the look of the 5 strings J Bass, but the sound of the PJ is killer! I would defenitely love to get one of these two beasts into my own hands. As I am a electric Bass beginner, I would be super grateful to learn step by step on one of these high quality instruments. I know the shipping to Germany will be a bit annoying but could you please make it happen ;-) - Additionally, I would finally upload the video of me you are requesting for quiet some time about what I am doing at the moment (trying to learn &quot;Man in the mirror&quot;) :-D.

Cheerio, 
Phil]]></description>
