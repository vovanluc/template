		<description><![CDATA[#DarkglassAlphaOmega I liked the Alpha with bite turned on and the Omega turned up. It might be my PC sound system but the mids came across very well. Pie in the sky comment - what if the peddle had an LFO between the alpha and omega limits!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alpha/Omega...not as important as the growl! If it ain&#039;t growlin&#039;, it ain&#039;t doing it&#039;s thang, so definitely turn on the growl.  I think the Omega gives a little touch of a synth feel, like maybe it belongs on a smashing pumpkins track, so that&#039;s cool.  Anyways, my two cents.  Cheers]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[#darkglassalphaomega, what a fantastic pedal! My preference is certainly towards the omega side. Love the way you can elaborate with the clean signal and keep the bottom end of your original tone. I would use the pedal to get just a little extra growl in my sound. Thanks for the demo! Kind regards, Fred]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[#DarkglassAlphaOmega  I liked the blend of the 2 distortions, maybe skewed a bit towards the Omega side. Certainly keep the blend knob at Noon (Can&#039;t lose the big booty!)

		<description><![CDATA[#DarkglassAlphaOmega 
Scott!!! 
Hey man, I really liked the Omega side with the Alpha blended in. When You did the half and half mix it seemed that leaning a little more to the Omega side would have been perfect and I thought that your demo sounded great with NO clean blended in. But like you said, there are a ton of possible tones and no doubt there are a lot more great ones in there! See you in the shed!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[#DarkglassAlphaOmega Hard to tell much of anything through computer speakers, but I think I liked the Alpha with some of the clean signal blended in.  Nice warm distortion with some oomph at the bottom.  Looks like a very versatile pedal!  Also, Scott, your playing continues to surprise and amaze me.  Give me another 10 years of SBL under my belt and I will be right there with you.]]></description>
