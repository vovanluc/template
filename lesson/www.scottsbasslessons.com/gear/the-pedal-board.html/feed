		<description><![CDATA[Hey man, I really dug your way of getting back some low end after all the signal processing, with the use of an octaver on a parallel loop. That might just be what I was looking for. One thing, though... I assume that on SOME tunes you will be using no effects at all (so no low end loss). Do you STILL keep the parallel octaver running, even when there&#039;s probably no need to beef up the lows?
Thanks, man! ^_^
Cheers!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seth, some pedals are junk for bass. I&#039;ve had issues using all kinds. I recently bought a TC Electronic Polytune, and that pedal is amazing. I would recommend it hands down over anything out there. It&#039;s pricey, so you may wanna try and get one used.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So, this may or may not be a silly question but I was wondering... does it matter what kind of tuning pedal you buy? are some better than others or do they all just do the same thing?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cool stuff, you should consider some Source Audio pedals also. Their Bass Envelope Filter Pro is great, and the POG 2 is amazing as well. I pretty much only use Source Audio products, they&#039;re a really great company. But I do love MOOG and that POG 2 is a must. Anyway, great stuff, really cool effects. I know on Source Audio&#039;s Multiwave Bass Distortion Pro pedal they have two seperate gain knobs, one for the clean channel and one for the distortion signal. Good luck with that delay.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott,

The Flash Back has a tap strum function. Just hold the switch down and it&#039;ll change to red and simply strum quarter notes.
Also check out the Line 6 M5 for synth and delay. Its pretty good for bass. And have tap tempo.

Thanks for awesome videos,

Kevin]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, 
First, a huge THANKS for all of these great lessons! I was curious if you&#039;ve looked into a new delay pedal. I just wanted to throw it out there...the Boss DD-7 digital delay works GREAT, has presets and allows a tap pedal (boss FS-5U) to set your tempo without twisting knobs. Also features a 45sec digital, stackable loop which has come in handy from time to time. Just thought I&#039;d mention it! Thanks again for sharing your knowledge!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,
I&#039;m not shure if i should buy a Boss ME-50B. Do you have any experience with this multi-effect borad? The Internet says more than less positiv things about this pedal-board.
What do you think? Is it a great alternate to single effect pedals?

Thanks and kind regards from switzerland

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott!
Thanks for all your valuable information. So...I just got this Cruise Ship gig with a good company. I take off in about 3 weeks. I needed to replenish some gear, since all I have since studying Jazz at the University of North Texas was my 100 year old German doublebass.  This gig is an all electric bass gig. I picked up a Fender Road Worn 50&#039;s P Bass, as I felt a P bass is a good utility bass for most of the material I&#039;ll be playing. 

Now...pedals???? This is an area foreign to me and I have never been a bass player who carried around a pedal board. Your pedal board explanation was very helpful. We are doing some tunes with obvious keyboard/synth bass lines ie. Michael Jackson tunes...PYT, Shake Your Body...etc. etc. What to get? I was thinking an EBS bass IQ Envelope Filter, EBS bass octave pedal, Ebs Multi Comp Compressor and maybe the Mooger Fooger like you have with or with out the expression pedal.  I&#039;ll also have a vintage Ibanez MC900 NT Fretless bass as well. what do you think? Also, I liked the Markbass synth pedal...maybe I should look for one of those. Oh yeah...also will look for a Line selector per your advice. Your thoughts are greatly appreciated!
Best regards,
Kurt

PS. I just bought your lesson bundle package for $37 bucks! Thanks!!]]></description>

You didn&#039;t include any compressors in your video. Do you normally use a compressor?

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott

Awesome vids! Do you know an effect which can bring the sound of my e-bass closer to the one of an upright? Think that someone told me once that an ocatver can do something in this direction. What do you think?

Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott,
Great to know what our Maestro uses :D if you are looking for some cool synth pedals check Pigtronix Mothership, Its a pretty crazy pedal and gives great synth sound &#038; POG2 is also a really good option.
Cheers]]></description>
