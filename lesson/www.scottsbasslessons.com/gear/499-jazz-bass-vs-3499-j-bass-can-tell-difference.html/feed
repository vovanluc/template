		<description><![CDATA[The thing I love is that the Sire basses offer a well-made and well-finished bass for the money. And because of this, tinkerers like myself have an excellent starting point and a strong aftermarket from which we can draw when we feel like modding a bass. 
The only Fender I own is a Frankenstein&#039;s monster of parts including a lefty MIJ Fender jazz neck on a right handed P-Bass body covered in pearlescent paint with a healthy dose of glitter in it, a Seymour Duncan SPB-1 and it&#039;s strung for BEAD tuning. It&#039;s a goofy thing to look at when I bring it on stage for a metal show.
But boy it&#039;s fun to play.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the blue Fender is #1. In fingerstyle they both sounded pretty much the same, perhaps #2 being ever so slightly darker and boomier, but in slapping #1 sounds more hi-fi for my ears, which I prefer for this style. In any case, point proved :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guessed right, Fender was bass #1, but I actually preferred the sound of the Sire.  I own a 2006 Fender Jazz V and find the pickups to be rather lacklustre, I&#039;ve just been rocking it all these years because as is the point of this video it&#039;s not about the tool but the artist.  I&#039;ll definitely be replacing the pickups sometime soon to get a fuller, punchier sound though.  Thanks for this video Scott!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Between expensive and bargain basses, I&#039;m mostly paying for the feel and playability. Of the two basses, the second one has more high end; but you can also tweak the EQ on either to get the sound more to your taste. I just happened to prefer Bass 1 and I think that is the blue one. 

I was mostly writing to comment on the colour of the &quot;orange&quot; neck. The old basses may (or may not) have arrived from the factory that colour, but they turned quite dark fairly soon... at least by the time they got to me. I like the feel of that finish--especially because it naturally wears off and does not grab your fingers on a gliss. Also, I heard that when it does wear off, the wood is still sealed for its protection. When CBS took over, they used a clear finish on the necks that they claimed was more durable; but did not allow for smooth sliding. Many of us would sand it off for comfort -- whether or not it was the healthiest thing for the bass, it worked for us. 

Hence, I LOVE that colour of neck on the blue bass... if not for the aesthetic, for what it brings back in memories! I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s the same finish as the pre-CBS, but I&#039;d have to feel it. It DOES look a little more orange than my &#039;65. 

This was a worth-while video; it helps the less wealthy players to appreciate the bass they can afford. It&#039;s like the diminishing rate of return on most expensive things; once you have covered the cost for decent quality, improvements cost substantially. 

Thanks Scott!
