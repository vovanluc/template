		<description><![CDATA[Hi ! In the workbook, i&#039;m not sure to get this right. I quote : 
&quot;Here&#039;s a short list of standards for you to try applying the two feel. It&#039;s
also a fantastic exercise to practice going between the two and four feel&quot;

I don&#039;t understand how I can play a 2 feel where I only hav a bar per measure (as it occurs in the 4 firts bars of Autumn Leaves).
Sorry for a question that might be dumb :-)
Cheers from France
Ps : I&#039;m now a lifetime membership, after a first year of practise, loving it, thanx for everything you&#039;ve done, it&#039;s impressive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, this would have helped me some time ago, but i do feel that the jazz section in this website is rather thin. I&#039;m at a level where all this is easy for me, but I have to learn so much more about walking anyway. Do you have more hidden knowledge that you can show us? How to think when songs are not diatonic at all, for example, Shorter&#039;s fee fi foo fum. 

How can one make long, yet musical basslines?

You are doing a good job with this website.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks again Scott, you continue to provide an invaluable service to many aspiring bassists.  Do you have any books that you can recommend in terms of music theory.  I would like to understand the theory behind the techniques and not just the techniques. If the listed material is adequate then I can just read that however if there are any other, I&#039;d love to take a look at it. Thank you]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, love your lessons. I&#039;m almost 2 years into my experience with the bass (at 44) and I have taken many lessons with a guitar teacher who, although helping a lot on the theory front I have the feeling he was missing on some of the specific requirements for bass playing. The way you explain the content in your lessons makes things really easy!!! thank you.
One question, after making a donation (which I have done) how do I access the PDF files for each lesson?
thanks]]></description>
