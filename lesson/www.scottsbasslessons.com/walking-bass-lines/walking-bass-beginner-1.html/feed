		<description><![CDATA[Question scott: In another video you talk about 5 mistakes and not cutting notes short, but you move your index finger from G to C at the third fret a number of times in this walking bass line. Is it that sometimes this rule of not cutting notes short can be broken, as there will be a slight gap when moving a single finger from one note to another  on another string? Or is it that you just practice crossing strings with a single finger enough until it blends well enough for the ear not to hear the gap?]]></description>

Another cool tool is Band in a Box for practicing, I use it regularely and you can easily find jazz standards or put in the chords yourself from a lead sheet (I&#039;m not working for PG music)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[scott wow where have you been?o these lessons are great. hey i started the bass three years ago. Im in my late forties and i have been taking bits and peices from everyone i can get a hold of. But i met a stalemate lately - what do i do now? I love reggae and being from the caribbean i kind of stick to reggae. I learn a lot of reggae tunes but i still felt stagnated. i could not hear a song and figure out what was going on. in fact i did not know what to study to learn the fret board. it was very frustrating until i came across your vdo, especially the one on using simple shapes to create bass lines. I think the vdo detailed E minor. Questions: does that for any minor note? For example can i start on any note using the same shape to do that? For example what if i decide to start on say the D note can i do the same thing? and will that work on any key? thanks man]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott,

Thanks so much for the tutorials.  I&#039;ve been a guitar player for years and dabbled with the bass.  Your info is helping me to make sense of my playing on this fabulous instrument.  Your tone always rocks by the way...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott

Despite having now replied to two of the earlier comments on this page, I am new to your site and new to playing bass. I am actually a piano/harpischord player who took up ukulele a year ago. I teach high school music in Australia and have 200 students in year 8 (that&#039;s around 13 years old for those in differing school systems) all very keen to start ukulele next week. 

I recently decided to purchase a bass ukulele to beef up the sound in the classroom (we use regular bass guitars but the room is small and the smaller the instruments, the better!).  My uBass arrived this week and I&#039;ve started looking for resources to teach myself. 

Of course, I was eager to play something fun, like a walking bass so this is what I went looking for. Other than tediously figuring out where the notes are on the bass using the semitones/frets as a guide, I have no idea where the notes really are. I guess I should go back to some more basic lessons...haha. 

I agree with one of the earlier commenters- it would be good to put up the tab with the video to show where the basic notes are. The entire tab isn&#039;t necessary, just each note as you show it. I understand you can download the pdf files but it is really helpful to see them screened with the video when starting out. (I use a lot of ukulele teaching videos with students that display the chords as it&#039;s so helpful.) I&#039;m sure this would also be helpful for those who have no idea what you&#039;re talking about when mentioning the 3rd and 5th and so on. 

Other than that, as an introduction to this site, I thought your lesson was FABULOUS. Thank you so much for sharing it.

cheerio, Lou]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes Duites, chords are usually built from the main note- called the &#039;root&#039; or the &#039;tonic&#039; then the 3rd and 5th notes above it. This makes up what is known as a triad. If you count up the notes, alphabetically, you&#039;ll find that all basic triads are made up of the notes 1, 3 and 5. 

For example, take the notes of the C major scale in order from lowest to highest:  C D E F G A B C.  To create the triad, start on the first note C as &#039;1&#039;, then 3 notes higher is the note E, and 5 notes higher than C is the note G. Therefore the C triad is made up ofthe notes C E and G. The notes don&#039;t have to be played in this order, but that is their fundamental make-up. 

From this, chords can be made up of many other combinations (eg a C7 is the notes C E G plus Bb- the 7th), but the triad is the basis for all these other chords.]]></description>
