		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott.

I&#039;m a fairly experienced player and I just about play professionally, but I&#039;ve always stayed away from jazz and told myself it&#039;s &#039;too hard&#039; and that I&#039;m &#039;not interested enough to study it properly&#039;. This 30 minute, two-part video on walking bass has summed up just about everything I&#039;ve ever figured out, and if I&#039;d seen this years ago I know I&#039;d be a LOT better now! Still, it&#039;s never too late! Combined with your &#039;shape-shifting&#039; video, which also addresses ii-V-I progressions, I&#039;ve been entertained for two straight days recording myself improvising and you know what? I&#039;m already listening back and thinking &#039;I can&#039;t believe that&#039;s me!&#039; You really are a fantastic teacher and a brilliant player. Many many thanks :)

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Scott. I love the way you taught the walking lessons. You really do what you said, you build it in blocks. At first it doesn&#039;t seem you&#039;re doing much, then you start adding in other notes slowly and surely, and next thing you know, it&#039;s starting to sound like something. I&#039;ll be sure to donate to get the .pdfs really soon.

I appreciate what you&#039;re doing, I was in a punk band and after I left them I kinda stopped. I got me a Musicmaster bass and it inspired me to play again, and I find myself keeping your site open in my tabs. The learning process is really addicting!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott! Great videos and some awesome insights! There&#039;s a &quot;concept&quot; that I&#039;ve been trying to wrap my head around. I am an extreme new player on the bass. (about 6 months in) I play at church and I fumble around and my band mates are kind enough to help me along and entertain my &quot;musings&quot;. But, there is a concept that I&#039;m not understanding very well, and that is, playing &quot;in front&quot; or &quot;behind&quot; the beat... Can you explain? or better yet do a vid on it? I know that this is a totally noob question. Thanks for you time! and keep up the great work!

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott, really enjoyed these walking bass lessons, has really taught me a lot, I find I stick too much to scales in one position has helped me move around the fret board a lot :)... 

In the first video you said you would upload the backing track to these 2 videos, could you let me know where that is please?

Cheers dude, 

Really enjoying your lessons! 

Keep &#039;em coming!]]></description>
