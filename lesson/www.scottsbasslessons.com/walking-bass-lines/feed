				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learning <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/notes/new-course-announcement-beginning-jazz-survival-guide-bassists.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to play walking bass lines</a> was <em>the</em> most important skill I ever worked on in terms of talking my bass playing to the next level. Period.</p>
<ul>
<li>It helped me understand and use <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/bass-arpeggio-lesson-fretboard.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arpeggios</a> in a practical and <i>musical</i> way (i.e. NOT just running aimlessly up and down 2 octave arpeggios</li>
<li>It helped me understand <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/live-sessions/getting-james-jamerson-sound-functional-harmony-live-stream-qa-scott.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">harmony</a> upon the fingerboard in a <em>much</em> deeper way</li>
<li>It VASTLY improved my <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/essential-shifting-lesson-bass.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">visualisation</a> of arpeggios and scales</li>
<li>It took my understanding and skills of <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/uncategorized/how-to-create-rb-bass-lines-and-grooves-with-danny-mo-morris.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating bass lines and grooves</a> to a completely different level</li>
<li>And WAY more... much more than I could ever write here.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, if you were to ask me what the '1 thing' is, that you could practice and would make the biggest difference to your understanding of the fretboard and how to navigate around it with ease... it would be walking bass lines. As a learning tool, they're that powerful.</p>
<p>So... I thought this would be fun...</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to teach you how to play walking bass lines... <strong>in less than 10 minutes</strong>...</p>
<p>Yep... less than 10 minutes!</p>
<p>Now... are you ready for the challenge?</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So What (originally composed by the great Miles Davis) is one of those tunes that get’s called <em>time and time again</em> at jam sessions.</p>
<p>In fact, if you’re starting to think about attending a local jam session, or if you’re already attending them - you <em>need</em> to know this tune. Simple as that.</p>
<p>The gag is, that due to it’s modal nature people tend to get lost within the form very easily and ultimately it can end in a total train wreck.</p>
<p>Honestly, I couldn’t count on <em>10 hands</em> the amount of times I’ve heard this tune end in disaster during jam sessions.</p>
<p>So - let's make sure that it doesn't happen when you're taking care of business! ;)</p>
<p><strong>Let’s look at the chord sequence: </strong></p>
<p>Dm7   | Dm7   | Dm7   | Dm7   |</p>
<p>Dm7   | Dm7   | Dm7   | Dm7   |</p>
<p>Ebm7 | Ebm7 | Ebm7 | Ebm7 |</p>
<p>Dm7   | Dm7   | Dm7   | Dm7   ||</p>
<p>As you can see, there’s a <em>lot</em> of Dm7 — and that is exactly where the problem is. When playing through this tune, if you don’t know how to map out the form you’re in danger of getting lost in a sea of Dm7 very easily.</p>
<p>But don’t worry, help is at hand!</p>
<p>In this lesson <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/todd-johnson" target="_blank">Todd Johnson</a> is going to show you a fantastic way of mapping out the form of So What by simply inserting II V <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/running-out-of-soloing-ideas-try-out-these-awesome-substitutions.html" target="_blank">substitutions</a> over the minor chords. By using this technique you’re not only going to give your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/using-pedal-points-bass-lesson.html" target="_blank">bass line</a> much more shape and contour, you’re also going to hold the rest of the band together in a way that everyone will know exactly where they are within the form. The cool thing is, they won’t even know why they're not getting lost anymore... all they’ll know, is that when they play with you - everything just works!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When I tell people you can make a metronome actually ‘swing’ I get some funny looks to say the least…</p>
<p>But, you certainly can make it <em>swing</em>!</p>
<p>A metronome can be an invaluable tool for bass players that are seeking to develop their groove and time feel. The key, is to find ways of using the metronome in a <em>musical way</em> that re-enforces your internal subdivision feel and in turn develops your overall groove.</p>
<p>In the past few lessons we’ve focused on getting your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/rythm/shuffle-bass-lesson.html" target="_blank">shuffle feel</a> together and strengthening your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/rythm/bass-groove-lesson.html" target="_blank">eighth note grooves</a>. In this lesson you’re going to learn how to make the metronome swing.</p>
<p>We’re going to start off slowly, so if you’re just starting out playing swing - this lesson will be great for you.</p>
<p>If you’re a more advanced player, don’t worry - I’ve included some exercises in this lesson that are going to make you <em>sweat</em>! ;)</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is part 2 of my walking bass lessons for the beginner jazz bass player, You can find <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/walking-bass-lines/walking-bass-beginner-1.html">Part 1 here</a>. In this lesson I expand on what we looked at within the first lesson and get you to start walking 4 in a bar using chord tones and chromatic passing tones.</p>
<p>When trying out these exercises remember - making it 'feel' good is SUPER important... if you're playing all the correct notes but your feel just isn't happening then that's going to be a big issue in the future. So... Feel, feel and more... FEEL!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Walking bass is something SOOO many bass players have difficulty with. But - It's really a lot easier than you think and hopefully, this series of walking bass lessons will help remove the confusion!</p>
<p>Through years of teaching and experimenting with different methods I've come up with my own 'fool proof' method of getting students well on their way to becoming great at creating their own walking bass lines.</p>
<p>In this walking bass lesson I show you how I actually teach my own personal students using this method and why they seem to be able to start creating there own walking bass lines much faster than most other students. That's why this lesson is great not only for student bassists but also bass teachers too. Try using this method with your students and you'll get amazing results - fast.</p>
<p>This is 'Part 1' of this lesson... <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/walking-bass-lines/walking-bass-beginner-2.html">check out Part 2</a>!!!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The walking bass lines video lessons show you an easy to understand and easy to put into practice method of creating walking bass lines.</p>
<p>Within this <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/free-video-bass-lessons/walking-bass-lines/">walking bass lesson</a> I discuss how to create lines when there is a static minor chord for an extended period of time. You can find this kind of chord sequence in jazz standards like 'So What' and 'Impressions'.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the first two lessons of this walking bass 'crash course', we've been practicing on a sequence with only one chord per bar.</p>
<p>Quick recap: in the <a title="Walking Bass Crash Course 1" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/walking-bass-lines/walking-bass-crash-course-lesson-1.html">first lesson</a>, we've played 'only' roots, fiths &amp; thirds and 'passing notes'. In the <a title="Walking Bass Lines Crash Course 2" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/walking-bass-lines/walking-bass-crash-course-lesson-2.html">second lesson</a>, we've added more chromatic notes. Hopefully you've practiced that, explored the variety of options that this gives you, and you're beginning to create walking bass lines that sound really good! Don't forget your <a title="Walking Bass - Improve Your Swing Feel!" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/rythm/walking-bass-swing-feel.html">swing feel</a> is key!</p>
<p>In this lesson, we're going to work on sequences with 2 chords per bar. Nothing to worry about... That's easy and fun! ;)</p>
<p>We're going to take a I-VI-II-V turnaround in the key of C. The chords are: C Major, A minor, D minor, G7. This turnaround is a <em>very</em>common one, so what you'll be learning here will be transposable to many many tunes.</p>
<p>I highly recommend you to practice over backing tracks! If you've got good backing tracks with piano &amp; drums or guitar &amp; drums, great! If not, you may be interested in my <a title="Backing Tracks for Bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/backing-tracks-bass">backing tracks packages</a> available. Actually, these packages are much more than just backing tracks, but I let you discover them if that's of interest to you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This series of walking bass lessons show you an easy-to-understand and easy to put into practice method to create walking bass lines.</p>
<p>This is the second part to my 'crash course' in <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/free-video-bass-lessons/walking-bass-lines/">walking bass lines</a>. As I said in the earlier tutorial, there's a lot to learn when it comes to creating good walking bass lines, but these lessons should get you on the right path as fast as possible, so you can start applying these concepts in real playing situations.</p>
<p>In the first video, we talked about using just root, 3rd, 5th and 'passing note' (one semi-tone below or above the first note of the next chord).</p>
<p>We've done that on <em>Autumn Leaves</em>, which is a great tune to start with. If you haven't already done so, you can download the lead sheet I've provided with the <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/walking-bass-lines/walking-bass-crash-course-lesson-1.html">first lesson</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully you've realised that we can create very nice walking bass lines using just these notes, especially if we use all the 3rds, 5ths and octaves available --i.e. above AND below. I recommend you practice just that for a while, exploring the different options available, before moving to the next step.</p>
<p>Done? So... next step! Very simple: we're going to add more chromatic notes, ascending and descending, to add a little bit more diversity to our walking bass lines. And if your <a title="Walking Bass - Improve your Swing Feel" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/rythm/walking-bass-swing-feel.html">swing feel"</a> is good, it should begin to sound the business ;).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These <strong>walking bass lessons</strong> show you an easy-to-understand and easy to put into practice method of creating a walking bass line.</p>
<p>In my younger years, I found myself in an awkward situation where I was asked to play some jazz type <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/free-video-bass-lessons/walking-bass-lines/">walking bass lines</a> for a band I was in... At the time I had NO IDEA how to create a walking bass line, so I had to come up with something fast that to get me out of trouble, keep the band happy and ultimately not get me the sack lol! (Getting the sack would have been even more complicated as the band I was working for was a full time pro band on a cruise ship... I might have got stranded in Barbados!... actually that sounds quite good!).</p>
<p>This is a quick tutorial explaining what walking bass lines are and more importantly how to get 'up and running' with them without having to get into too much theory.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When playing <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/walking-bass-lines/walking-bass-beginner-2.html">walking bass lines</a>, your feel is absolutely key to make everything 'sit' as it should within the context of whichever ensemble you're playing. The exercises presented within this lesson should help you on your way to strengthening your internal clock and improving your walking bass swing feel.</p>
<p>Whether you've already watched my other <a title="Walking Bass Series" href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/walking-bass-lines/walking-bass-beginner-1.html">lessons on walking bass</a> or not, this one is very important: you can play all the 'right' notes, simple or more sophisticated walking bass lines, if your swing feel isn't good enough, it's gonna sound like... well, it won't sound as good as it should. ;)</p>
