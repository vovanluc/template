		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,
Just wondering, when you use the II V in your bass line, does it matter if the guitarist doesn&#039;t do the same? Or do you both need to be doing the same thing?
Cheers!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi scott, slightly confused ... You mention starting in D Dorian, then going to E half diminished. Here&#039;s my question: I understand the half diminished (m7b5) to be the Locrian mode, but if you are working from the D Dorian, wouldn&#039;t you go to E Phrygian (m7b9) instead? What I think is happening is this: because you like the use of the D Dorian with a sharp 5 to provide the cool chromatic note, what you have done is to shift from the D Dorian to the D Aeolian. Hence the E now becomes the E Locrian to keep the sexy D with the sharp 5 .... Whaddya reckon? Cheers, Steve.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When you&#039;re playing a jazz gig how fancy is your walking? You&#039;ve got such great chops, and love the fancy walking, but how practical is it in a live setting? One thing I always try to do is play less to let the soloists shine through. Maybe a lesson (unless there already is one) about when to get fancy and when to step back and just play quarters?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hallo Scott,
I have the same problems as Kevin. I studied music theory many years ago and forgot a lot about chords and progressions. Aniways I like your lessons and I&#039;m trying to learn walking bass with you.
A question¨! Did you send to subscribers the pdf of Autonm Leaves Walking bass line or you wanted that we try it by our self? 
Thank you and best regards.
BEN from Lugano.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[love the facial expressions :-) great lesson. you&#039;ve basically shown how to use a chromatic scale effectively.you&#039;ve almost used every note in it. so easy to understand what you mean, sometimes hard to translate that to my guitar though:-) my theory isn&#039;t brilliant, when you mention the em b dim and a7 etc i get a tad confused.are they just the notes names relative to the scale?]]></description>
