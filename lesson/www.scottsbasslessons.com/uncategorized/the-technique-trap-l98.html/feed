		<description><![CDATA[I started recently to play serious Jazz standards in a band (before that I listened to them, played some of the best known standards as a training, but that was all...) and that brought me on the right track. It&#039;s a great way to implement chord tones, arpeggios, scales, &quot;sexy notesðŸ˜‰&quot;, walking baselines and chromatic approaches within a certain scale. 
And: I stopped playing as many notes as I could play; instead I learned to play what was needed. It&#039;s &quot;the art of omission&quot;, instead of showing of your skills....ðŸ˜°

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott I actually did try out to play with some church folks they gave me a bunch of songs to practice and I did.
I memorize about five songs they wanted to perform for starters nothing to hard, Then on the try out session my five string was tuned to E-flat so I was a semi tone of so the other bass player hands me his four string P-Base mind you up until then I had been practicing on a five string so when I started playing I started off on the wrong string needles to say I was out of key I was playing a fifth higher so everybody is looking at me funny. I finally figure out it&#039;sbecause im playing a four string and not my five but by that time the other bas player had tuned mine so he hands it back to me tune in key but now my base sounds funny I could figure out why you could hear everything that I did every little squeek my fingers sliding on the string everything so I keeped going but I noticed the singer slowing her tempo and so was every body else so I slowed down with them as to keep pace I guess they where trying to see if I could keep time or some thing any way all of a sudden the singer looks at me and gives me some kind of que hand gesture that aparrently ment either keep it going wich was all new to me but before i knew it the audition was over and the singers walked off the stage and the music directore said were done here I&#039;m like ok, on the drive home i couldnt figure out why my bass sounded so different I thought it was the PA system but when I got home and started to practice I notice all my knobs had been turned all the way up and that when I realized I had been set up for failure.How dirty is that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Got the call to play with Texas-Blues axeman Howlin&#039; Waters. I did pretty good with the different styles of boogie woogie and straight blues. But when he said the next one will be a rhumba, stay on the one and I&#039;ll signal you for changes, I thought &quot;Oy! A rhumba? What&#039;s a rhumba?&quot;

I think I did okay. I stuck within the chord tones and played a groove that seemed natural. No one complained. Definitely not in my wheelhouse yet. Thanks to what I&#039;ve learned at the SBL Academy I finished the gig and am expecting a call back. But that&#039;s an area for technique I need to work on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Put some ads in the local music stores Paul. I always found the community in the Bradford/Leeds area to be very open when it came to jamming - especially if you have a decent practice location already :) 



There again, my experiences in that area were 35 years ago :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is a Bass player called Paul Wolfe who runs a site called www.how-to-play-bass.com.
He reckons that playing scales and theory holds you back and although you should take time to learn them, That learning songs is going to make you play better quicker.
He thinks that when you join a band they are not interested in how many scales you know but how many songs you have in your repertoire to play covers, And that&#039;s what you will spend a lot of your time doing.


There is so many people with loads of different opinions that it makes your head spin at times]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m in the same boat if i&#039;m honest!
I have been playing on my own for just over two years and it is just a hobby for me at this stage.
I have learned different bits and pieces of things from books which you do end up forgetting and it is a bit daunting all the technical stuff.
I struggle with learning the fret board and remembering all the notes off different keys etc.


My cousin has played in bands for years and recently told me to get out there and play with other people.
The trouble is, Who do you play with?
I don&#039;t know anyone who is involved in the music scene and established musicians probably wouldn&#039;t give you the time of day or play with you anyway.
I bet there would be a certain level of snobbery towards someone who is at my level!


The trouble is when you play on your own you do not know if you are any good and where you might be going wrong.
The level i am at now is i am starting to play along with original tracks from my favourite bands.
These are not hard lines and i am playing punk bass lines from bands like the Exploited and The Cockney Rejects etc
Although these lines are very fast and it takes a lot physically to keep up with them so i suppose it is good practice in a way.


I am also learning from &quot;The Hal Leonard- Easy Pop Songs&quot; books so it is like playing in a band to an extent.
I will have to try and get the confidence to try and see if there is anyone in my area who i can play with!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been an &quot;accompanist&quot; on bass for many years, having learned to play before anybody really expected the bassist to have very much technique. People seem to like my playing and nearly always ask me back to play again or to join their bands. However, there has been a series of technique revolutions - Jaco Pastorius, Larry Graham, Victor Wooten, Gary Willis - that have expanded the bass guitar as an instrument in directions I don&#039;t feel capable of following technically. What I particularly like about the SBL lessons is the musical context for the technical discussions. Technique is not for its own sake, but to serve the music.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would say that i&#039;m trapped by the other side... I&#039;ve learn bass basics with a teacher for a year, then lost my Father. So I&#039;ve only played with friends and never stopped for twenty years from now. I compose and gig but do not have any theory for that :/
Last year i dÃ©cided to Take lessons to improve my bass level. Took a year of lessons, then I found you. You&#039;re an awesome teacher. So I practice your lessons every evening... Looks like it works !
Thank you so much Scott !]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,for me it&#039;s also the other way around. I started this old 
school hard rock band last year where we play our own songs and rehearse
 about every week. Old school HR is not exactly the kind of music where 
you, let&#039;s call it fiddle (sorry, I&#039;m dutch) around the root. Of corse I 
try to make the bass lines as interesting as possible using scales, but 
for a lot of songs it feels better to keep them going strait on together
 with the bass drum and let that train roll.
Anyway, I really do want to get my playing to a higher level and I think I watched about most of your video&#039;s, but I can&#039;t get it into practice.
So what to do?

Cheers mate ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What exercises would you recommend for drummers and bassists to do together as a rhythm section to learn new rhythms, accents etc? I playwith a drummer that I&#039;ve played with for a very long time, and we talk about this often. We are very sometime in odd meters, but different rhythms and subdivisions are something that we struggle with a but learning to do together. Any suggestions? Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, nice to see the P-bass in action! I am in total agreement with you and I am fortunate to have a professional gigging musician as a teacher (no names, no pack drill :-) who I play with each week. Also there are plenty of other local musicians I sometimes join. My teacher is recognised as a great bassist, partly because of his feel for harmony and I would like to develop my harmonic skills for live playing. Help? As always great advice.]]></description>
