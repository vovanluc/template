				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm on holiday with the family right now (and LOVING it!), but, I really didn't want to skip a week and not send you anything... so, I thought I'd treat you to something I usually keep only for members of the membership here at SBL.</p>
<p>And, if you're already a member at SBL I'm sure it's been a while since you watched this, so you're going to love it too...</p>
<p>Just over a year ago, Victor Wooten swung by SBL Towers... and obviously we grabbed a camera and filmed an entire interview with him whilst he was here!</p>
<p>As you'd expect, he dropped some serious knowledge bombs such as;</p>
<ul>
<li>How he picked up the bass aged two and was playing live at the ripe old age of six!</li>
<li>How he was tutored by his four brothers, particularly his guitar-playing brother Regi.</li>
<li>How he learned to tap by listening to Stanley Jordan.</li>
<li>About his collaboration with Stanley Clarke and Marcus Miller under the moniker of SMV</li>
<li>And much, much more…</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)<br />
<strong><br />
PS. Don't forget that we've got over 70 more awesome interviews over on SBL! If you wanna check them out, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/podcast/best-bits">just click here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>===</p>
<h1>Lesson Overview</h1>
<p>There's so much we can learn by analysing and learning great <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/bass-groove-lesson-vocabulary.html" target="_blank">bass lines</a>. That's how we really begin to learn the language of music... listening to what others have done before us, trying to copy what we hear, repeating that process until it becomes 'our own', analysis, and then applying what we've learned to create own own bass lines and <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/bass-riff-week-1.html" target="_blank">grooves</a>.</p>
<p>It's exactly how we learned to speak when we were children...</p>
<p>Listening to our parents, copying noises, the noises turn into words, the words turn into sentences and so on.</p>
<p>That's why I thought it'd be fun to share one of my favourite bass lines with you... "I Want You Back" by The Jackson 5, originally played by the great Wilton Felder.</p>
<p>Here's what you'll be learning in this lesson:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of chord tones and chromatic approach notes</li>
<li>The theory behind the riff</li>
<li>The chord sequence it's constructed on</li>
<li>The different fingerings you can use to play this riff</li>
</ul>
<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>What are your favourite "classic" bass lines?</p>

<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

<p>
<p>===</p>
<h1>Lesson Overview</h1>
<p>Around a year ago I was lucky enough to get introduced to <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/danny-mo-morris" target="_blank">Danny Mo Morris</a> (one of the longest serving <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/expert-faculty" target="_blank">faculty members</a> at the world famous Berklee College of Music… and one of my favourite educators).</p>
<p>We ended up hitting it off (a mutual love of groove!) and since then he’s become involved in what we do here at The <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy" target="_blank">SBL  Academy</a> in a big way.</p>
<p>He has a masterclass on R&amp;B bass in the Academy course library, does regular live-stream seminars for the Academy students, and we’ve also just created a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/the-motown-masters-bootcamp" target="_blank">8 week long online-bootcamp</a> together (which right now is in it’s 4th week and going strong!).</p>
<p>When it comes to bass line and groove creation (something every bass player should be constantly working on) Danny nails it every time with his concepts and insights into how you should be approaching this invaluable skill.</p>
<p>As Danny says… <i>“You jam, you play, you practice - but how do you focus on the creation of solid bass parts and vocabulary development on your own?”</i></p>
<p>Well, in this lesson Danny is going to show you how to that and how to use some key concepts including…</p>
<ul>
<li>Locking in with the kick-drum by using 2 and 4 bar phrases.</li>
<li>How to “Frame” your bass lines.</li>
<li>How to develop you vocabulary and “organisation skills” - something that everyone expects bass players to do, but for one reason or another is something that never get’s discussed.</li>
</ul>
<p>PS. Danny’s bass tone is huuuuge! If you listen to this lesson through tiny phone or laptop speakers the bass will sound a little low in the mix as the speakers can’t handle the low-end - if that’s the case, use some headphones - you’ll love his tone! :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Your Homework</h1>
<p>More often than not this style of bass line is very syncopated, so it's a fantastic way of developing your overall groove, feel and pocket. Are you already transcribing <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/palm-muting-lesson.html" target="_blank">R&amp;B/Motown</a> bass lines? If you are, which are your favourites and which have you found most challenging?</p>
<p>Let us know in the comments below!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There's something we can all be 100% certain of...</p>
<p>At some point we're all going to want to play a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/cool-bass-lick.html" target="_blank">lick</a>, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/vital-groove-technique-below-the-root.html">groove</a>, or <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/awesome-bass-solo-lesson.html" target="_blank">solo line</a> that will be out of our comfort zone - and clearly beyond where our technical capabilities are right now on the bass.</p>
<p>If you've experienced this before or experiencing this right now, don't worry - every single bass player has this issue. Even guys that have a highly developed bass technique such as Victor Wooten, Alain Caron and Jeff Berlin for example will all have these issues at some point.</p>
<p>It's easy to think that once you get to your technique to certain level you will develop bass super powers that will make you indestructible - even the worlds toughest lick will be a like a walk in the park...</p>
<p>Well, I'm here to tell you that it won't.</p>
<p>Yes, as your technique develops certain things will become a lot easier, but at some point you'll be asked to perform a piece of music that has hiding within it a "<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/bass-lick-vocabulary-workshop.html" target="_blank">lick of doom</a>" ;)</p>
<p>It's happened to me personally countless times, and I can guarantee that every bass player on the planet has encountered such a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/awesome-chromatic-lick.html" target="_blank">lick</a> - whatever level they're at.</p>
<p>To be honest, it's a complicated subject - as what one bass player finds easy, another bass player will find hard - no matter if they're at the same level technical proficiency.</p>
<p><em>Why you ask?!</em></p>
<p>Well, that's just the way it works. We're all physically different, and therefore certain physical movements might be easier for one player than an other.</p>
<p>Also, what a player's focus has been comes into play...</p>
<p>Victor Wooten has crazy <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/slap-bass-lesson-the-sectret-triplet-technique.html" target="_blank">slap chops</a>, we can all be certain about that - whereas Jeff Berlin has an insane <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/fast-legato-lines-on-the-bass.html" target="_blank">legato technique</a>. If these players were asked to play each others lines, they would certainly have some challenges ahead of them - even though they both have highly developed techniques.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm certain they'd be able to "get it"... but it might not be as easy as you'd think.</p>
<p>So, how should we go about learning complicated licks, riff, and bass lines?!</p>
<p>There's obviously the "start slow and build it up" technique, which works great. But, in this lesson I'm also going to show another great technique that I use all the time when trying to master really tricky technical lines that are slightly out of my comfort zone.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There's something we can all be 100% certain of...</p>
<p>At some point we're all going to want to play a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/cool-bass-lick.html" target="_blank">lick</a>, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/vital-groove-technique-below-the-root.html">groove</a>, or <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/awesome-bass-solo-lesson.html" target="_blank">solo line</a> that will be out of our comfort zone - and clearly beyond where our technical capabilities are right now on the bass.</p>
<p>If you've experienced this before or experiencing this right now, don't worry - every single bass player has this issue. Even guys that have a highly developed bass technique such as Victor Wooten, Alain Caron and Jeff Berlin for example will all have these issues at some point.</p>
<p>It's easy to think that once you get to your technique to certain level you will develop bass super powers that will make you indestructible - even the worlds toughest lick will be a like a walk in the park...</p>
<p>Well, I'm here to tell you that it won't.</p>
<p>Yes, as your technique develops certain things will become a lot easier, but at some point you'll be asked to perform a piece of music that has hiding within it a "<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/bass-lick-vocabulary-workshop.html" target="_blank">lick of doom</a>" ;)</p>
<p>It's happened to me personally countless times, and I can guarantee that every bass player on the planet has encountered such a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/awesome-chromatic-lick.html" target="_blank">lick</a> - whatever level they're at.</p>
<p>To be honest, it's a complicated subject - as what one bass player finds easy, another bass player will find hard - no matter if they're at the same level technical proficiency.</p>
<p><em>Why you ask?!</em></p>
<p>Well, that's just the way it works. We're all physically different, and therefore certain physical movements might be easier for one player than an other.</p>
<p>Also, what a player's focus has been comes into play...</p>
<p>Victor Wooten has crazy <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/slap-bass-lesson-the-sectret-triplet-technique.html" target="_blank">slap chops</a>, we can all be certain about that - whereas Jeff Berlin has an insane <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/fast-legato-lines-on-the-bass.html" target="_blank">legato technique</a>. If these players were asked to play each others lines, they would certainly have some challenges ahead of them - even though they both have highly developed techniques.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm certain they'd be able to "get it"... but it might not be as easy as you'd think.</p>
<p>So, how should we go about learning complicated licks, riff, and bass lines?!</p>
<p>There's obviously the "start slow and build it up" technique, which works great. But, in this lesson I'm also going to show another great technique that I use all the time when trying to master really tricky technical lines that are slightly out of my comfort zone.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this lesson I'm going to explain why getting together with friends to practice and jam with is a key part of your progression as a bass player and musician. Once I started to meet up with other musicians for group practice sessions and jams my bass playing started to progress faster than ever before. In fact I'd argue that most of my "big leaps" happened while playing with other musicians. This isn't to say that practising on your own isn't important... it's absolutely invaluable and something you must be doing if you want to push your bass playing to the next level! But, playing with other musicians is also extremely important, and if you're not doing it on a regular basis yet I urge you to give it a try.</p>
<p>Now grab you're bass and get in the shed!</p>
