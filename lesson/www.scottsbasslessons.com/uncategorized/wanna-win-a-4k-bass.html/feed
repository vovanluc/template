		<description><![CDATA[This probably won&#039;t get read now, but I agree completely about not using Facebook. Unfortunately, I think along similar lines about Twitter. I&#039;ve been using the internet since the mid-90s, ICQ, chat rooms and all, but I don&#039;t like what that has turned into.
Scott, sorry for boring you! Great lessons for a guitarist getting his head around REAL bass playing. Many thanks, mate!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Stephe I totally understand where you&#039;re coming from. I went with facebook as I had to choose one of the social media channels to run the competition on and it seemed like facebook was the most popular - the others been Google + and Twitter. But...  I&#039;m looking into this now. There might be a way to use twitter instead. So, I&#039;ll keep you posted ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott -- I am a long-standing fan of your site and have recommended it to a couple of friends, but along with others here I am unwilling to join facebook for reasons that have nothing to do with you or your site.  
I do understand that you are trying to make a living from your site and do not begrudge you this, and that getting people to &#039;like&#039; you is one way to boost your online profile, but I am disappointed that you effectively make entry to your competition contingent upon membership of a particular &#039;social media network&#039; -- perhaps you could remedy this?   Either way, thanks for providing an excellent resource for bass-players, and good luck with the new-look site.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if others did the same but I remember suggesting a bass guitar giveaway when you were asking for ideas for adding more members to the &quot;shed&quot; and making their stay more interesting. I&#039;m sure by now Overwater has become a household brand and far from obscurity (at least from where I come from - Asia) and most of that can be attributed to your lessons videos than anything else.
We won&#039;t be surprised if more brands follow suit. Thanks for the chance, Scott, the free lessons alone make us all winners already, this bass, and hopefully more of similar promos from more advertisers to come soon! Thanks a lot!]]></description>
