<p>If you're aiming at being a pro bass player, being able to play a <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/quick-riff/victor-bailey-slap-quick-riff.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">great slap bass line</a> is essential and something that you'll be expected to do for certain songs and styles.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I thought I'd share what I believe to be the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2 BIG slap bass mistakes</strong></span> I see countless bass players making.</p>
<p>As always, I want hear back from you guys... make sure you let me know whether you've either made or are currently making these mistakes in the comments under the video.</p>
<p>Ooo... and I also announce the winner of the <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/gear/coolest-bass-distortion-pedal-ever-darkglass-alpha-omega-unboxing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Darkglass Alpha Omega pedal</a> competition too...</p>
<p>See you in the shed,</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. If you tried to get one of our 'SBL One-Strap's" last time but missed it, I've got HUGE news...</p>
<p>We're about to open the doors once again and give members of the SBL community the chance to order their 'One Strap'.</p>
<p>The gag is, we're only going to have a TINY amount of straps available, so if you want to grab your chance of getting one when we open the doors you can jump on the <a href="https://scotts-bass-lessons.myshopify.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waiting list by clicking here</a>.</p>
<p>Last time we completely sold out in under 24 hours... so make sure you get on the <a href="https://scotts-bass-lessons.myshopify.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waiting list</a>, as that way you'll be the first to find out once they're available.</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>Last Friday I released a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/quick-riff/victor-bailey-slap-quick-riff.html" target="_blank">riff analysis</a> lesson of one of the best slap riff's of all time... "<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/slap-bass-lessons/probably-the-best-slap-bass-riff-ever.html" target="_blank">Hair</a>" by the godfather of funk - Mr Larry Graham...</p>
<p>Well, the response from that lesson was simply off the chart... so, I thought I'd hit you with another EPIC slap riff!</p>
<p>In this lesson you're going to learn the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/will-lee-bass-line-analysis.html" target="_blank">bass line</a> to "Forget Me Nots"... played by the legendary "Ready" Freddie Washington.</p>
<p>Like last week's lesson, this is another iconic slap bass riff and there's so much that can be learned from studying this great groove....</p>
<p>I show you the riff, break it down slowly, and then explain why and how the actual riff works, from a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/live-sessions/getting-james-jamerson-sound-functional-harmony-live-stream-qa-scott.html" target="_blank">harmony</a> perspective, so you can take this information and use it in your own <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/riff-of-the-week/slap-time-bass-riff.html" target="_blank">slap riffs</a>.</p>
<p>Ready to get your funk on? Let's do this!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. I just want to give a HUGE shout out to everyone that took part in our huge bass gear giveaway in October... if you weren't the winner, I've got good news... we're kicking off another giveaway next week. We'll be giving away some insane gear, including a full bass stack! So... keep a look out next week in your inbox because you won't want to miss this one!</p>

<p>In this lesson I'm going to teach you one of the best <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/slap-bass-lesson.html" target="_blank">slap</a> riffs of all time!</p>
<p>I show you the riff, break it down slowly, and then explain why and how the actual riff works from a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/live-sessions/getting-james-jamerson-sound-functional-harmony-live-stream-qa-scott.html" target="_blank">harmony</a> perspective so you can take this information and use it in your own <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/riff-of-the-week/slap-time-bass-riff.html" target="_blank">slap riffs</a>.</p>
<p>I expect you're wondering what the riff is, right?</p>
<p>It was written by the godfather of slap, Mr Larry Graham, and performed with his band 'Graham Central Station"...</p>
<p>The name of the song... "Hair"... and yep, and I've not got much of that! ;)</p>
<p>Oh, and just a word of warning... it's so funky it'll even get your mother dancing! ;)</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. As I've mentioned, we're about to release the SBL Academy 2.0 - which is a completely overhauled version of the current Academy here at Scott's Bass Lessons.</p>
<p>It's been 7 months in the making, and in a nutshell we've built the entire platform from the ground up - enhanced functionality, new design, global search functions and MUCH more.</p>
<p>When we make the switch to the new design, the enrolment price for the Academy will be going up, so right now is the cheapest the annual enrolment will ever be. So, if you've been thinking about jumping on board and enrolling in the Academy, now is the time!</p>
<p>PLUS - Just to sweeten the deal for you, we're also offering a totally free 30 day trial too - so you can take the entire Academy for a test drive for a whole month completely risk free to see if it's for you.</p>
<p>If you want the full video tour of the Academy <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/notes/sbl-academy-online-bass-education.html" target="_blank">click here.</a></p>

<h1>Lesson Overview</h1>
<p>Ok, get ready to get your thumb out... we're delving into the world of "<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/slap-bass-lesson.html" target="_blank">slap bass</a>"!</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to be showing you a great <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/riff-of-the-week/slap-time-bass-riff.html" target="_blank">slap riff</a> that incorporates what I refer to as 'downbeat displacement', something that great bassists such as Marcus Miller and Victor Wooten use extensively within their slap lines and grooves.</p>
<p>When we play riffs and grooves, so much of it is based around habits and muscle memory - that's why if you've been playing bass for a while you'll have had many of those <em>"I just feel like I play the same old stuff over and over"</em> moments. If you haven't had any yet, trust me you will... and they can be immensely frustrating.</p>
<p>I mention this, as it's so common to see beginner to intermediate players constantly using their thumb on the downbeat of beat 1 within every measure. There's certainly nothing wrong with doing this, but it's not our only option - and when creating your own bass lines and grooves it can be very liberating when you realise you don't have to use your thumb on the first downbeat of every measure. The gag is, if you haven't done this before it might feel a little strange to start with. But as with anything, the more you play the riff the more natural it will feel.</p>
<p>Also, when playing this riff make sure you have a nice and <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/beginners/slap-bass-getting-started.html" target="_blank">fluid technique</a> as any tension within the slapping arm will make it very difficult to achieve the groove and feel you're trying to create.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Slap bass is undoubtably one of the most popular and recognizable techniques when playing bass so I thought it was about time to get our thumbs out for this weeks Bass Riff of The Week!</p>
<p>The key of E is one of the most popular key centers to create slap riffs around as having the open E within the groove means we can player higher up the neck, but still utilize the low E within the riff. This makes it easier than if the root note was G for instance, as if we wanted to incorporate the low G within the riff we'd most probably have to play the majority of the riff in the lower area of the neck.</p>
<p>I've actually recorded a full lesson on this a few months ago called "Breaking The Mould" <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/slap-bass-lesson-breaking-the-mould.html">that you can check out here</a>. If you want to investigate playing slap riffs in other key centers than E.</p>
<p>That said, I still love to create slap <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/slap-bass-lesson-the-sectret-triplet-technique.html">riffs in E </a>but with this weeks riff I've decided to incorporate some double stop type ideas and also some lines that require you to slap and pop on adjacent strings - and this can be quite tricky if you haven't tried this before.</p>
<p>My aim with this riff is to push you out of your comfort zone and show you that even when a slap riff is in the key of E... it can still be challenging and fun to master.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

<p>Ok, I think you'll be in agreement... Slap bass is simply one of the coolest and funkiest techniques you can use on bass!</p>
<p>Unfortunately for many players it's really hard just to get <em>up and running</em> with this technique and much of this is down to the movement of their slapping arm. More likely than not they're using too much forearm movement and not enough forearm rotation, which is what I believe is the best and easiest way to get that snappy slap sound you associate with bass players such as Larry Graham and Marcus Miller.</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to focus on movement and take you through two great plucking hand exercises will help you get the correct fluidity of movement you'll need to start creating and playing great slap bass lines.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mixing <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html">plucking</a> and <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/slap-bass-lesson.html">slapping</a> techniques on the bass is something that I rarely see discussed, but is used extensively by many of the worlds top bass players. You’ll have heard it used on many records thousands of times before, most likely without even noticing it as it’s something that can go under the radar so easily even though it’s a huge reason why the bass line sound so damn funky :)</p>
<p>In this lesson I deconstruct the bass line from the famous Jocelyn Brown tune “Somebody Else’s Guy”. This is a perfect example of two different plucking techniques being used in conjunction with each other to give the bass line that “slap bass” feel, but still with the control and tightness of a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/bass-right-hand-muting-floating-thumb.html">finger style bass</a> line.</p>
<p>“Somebody Else’s Guy” was the first song I started using within my practice time to get used to swapping between <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/slap-bass-lesson-the-sectret-triplet-technique.html">slapping</a> and plucking techniques within the same bass line. Initially it’s a lot trickier that you might think as it’s easy to start rushing the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/creating-bass-grooves.html">groove</a> when swapping between the two styles.</p>
<p>Good luck…</p>
<p>And as always, see you in the shed!</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this <strong>slap bass lesson</strong> I'm going to show you a technique that I use a lot. I say 'secret' because it's so hard to see what's going on within slap bass lines sometimess that it's easy to miss the simple little techniques that are thrown into the mix of a groove to give the bass line that super percussive vibe.</p>
<p>Within this tutorial I'm going to peel back the layers of a slap groove and highlight where I'm using these 'secret triplets' to really enhance the overall groove and vibe of the bass line!</p>
<p>Now grab your bass and get in the shed!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok... we ALL like <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/slap-bass-lesson.html">slap bass</a> right?... I'm sure when you first heard your first slap bass riff you thought it was the coolest thing you'd ever heard! Well... me too! But - one thing that so many bass players suffer from is only being able to play slap riffs in the key of E. This happens because we rely way too much on the open E string and tend to get panicked if we have to slap in a different key.</p>
<p>Well in this bass lesson I'm going to show you how to break that mould! With a little hard work you're going to be able to slap in any key!</p>
<p>Now grab you're bass and get in the shed!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can you believe it? A SLAP bass lesson, finally! I've had sooo many e-mails over the last few months asking me to put together a lesson covering slap bass... I've finally given in!</p>
<p>Some of you were even wondering if I had anything against slap bass! I don't, really, and I do have fun with it, occasionally. The only reason I've stayed away from uploading bass lessons on this style, is that I know that bass students can easily get stuck in what I call the "slap bass void": it's fun, it <em>can</em> sound great, you can impress your friends relatively easily... ;)</p>
<p>The risk is that you forget about the rudiments of music, i.e. chord tones, scales, arpeggios, harmony, etc. and never become a well-rounded bass player, able to play with other musicians in a variety of styles --or in any style of music.</p>
<p>And do you think a great slap bass player like, say... Victor Wooten, knows all the stuff I mentioned above? You bet he does!</p>
<p>Now, after these words of caution and wisdom ;), let's slap it!</p>
