		<description><![CDATA[Ah, so you hammer on on those fast repeated F# and G#. I&#039;ve seen dudes try to slap every single note, other - myself included - try to do an &quot;upstroke slap&quot; a-la Victor Wooten (how does he call it? Double thumbing? Can&#039;t remember ;-) ).
Anyway, whatever works, I guess... the important thing is to keep the groove! ^_^]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello, I really loved that line back then in years when internet wasnt here. I knew it from George Michael - Fastlove (second half of the song). Very cool. Nobody knew back then who plays the bass. I learned it from cassette tape. Few years later came song Men in Black and finally with internet I could hear original - Patrice Rushen.
Have a nice day.

		<description><![CDATA[Very nice lesson. Such a cool riff...  to David Coleman; not sure where you&#039;re coming from. Ghost notes sound great played tight with a drummer, adding massively to the groove. A very valid technique. If they sound sloppy, maybe you&#039;re having trouble with it? Similarly, when bass players say &#039;I don&#039;t do slap&#039;, often what they mean is they can&#039;t do slap. ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott 

I&#039;ve been watching the L#218 and my suggestion is to repeat it in ultrarapide in the lessen video.. It would be to a great help at least for us who are a bit slow to take in this type riffs.  I believe it would beneficial for most of your riff-lessons.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve got to say it sounds really cool but it is an example of what the bassists role is not. If you are doing that, you are doing the drummers job and I think ghost notes evolved from guys who were missing the notes they were trying to play. So, they just decided since they could not play the notes they would call it a technique. Its a sloppy way to play.]]></description>
