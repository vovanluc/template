		<description><![CDATA[technically, that is incorrect. Db minor is the relative minor to Fb major; that&#039;s why the above comment says it would be a key signature with eight flats! 

C# minor is the relative to E major, hence the 4 sharps.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can I suggest that when a lesson features a particular song, or artist, that you mention that in the description?  As a rule, I&#039;m not a fan of slap bass, but I forced myself to watch this.  What a thrill to learn that it featured Meshell Ndegeocello, one of my favourite bassists!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dbm is the relative minor of E major so it has the same key signature as E with 4 sharps.  Both of these scales have the exact same notes - its just the starting note (root) is different.  E major scales starts with the E note, Db minor scales starts with the Db note.You can find the relative minor of any major scale by going down three half-steps (frets) lower.  Another example, Am is the relative minor of C major.  If you start on the 8th fret of the E string (C note) and go down (lower) 3 frets you wind up on the 5th fret which is an A note.  C major scale is C D E F G A B while A minor scale has same notes but different order D E F G A B C.]]></description>
