		<description><![CDATA[Transcribing is an ear art ( know you know that ) like drawing is for the eyes . I haven&#039;t formally taken a music degree besides band 12 but when playing with my old pro gig I used to transcribe for the whole band . This included a 16 year grade 8 royal conservatory trained pianist, Berkeley grad bass player , guitarist and drummer who all had touring experience as well. I wish I could tell you a secret but there isn&#039;t any but consistently listening to pieces and breaking them down . If you know a little music theory then by the sound of things you can begin to instantly know what it is eg that sounds sad probably a minor key  , or last chord was the root this next run is in the 4( in a 1-4-5 typical progression ) . It can be tedious but the reward is freedom
From tablature and being able to play what you hear WHEN you hear it . A musician who learns by ear sticks out from tab learners . They are the players with much more attention to detail warmth and personality in their playing . It&#039;s well worth it especially when playing live with other musicians . You&#039;ll gain a confidence that will open the doors to a magical world . Good luck !]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Loved the vid! I&#039;m going to wait until I get my bass that I have ordered, a couple weeks,  before I sign up. This lesson was great, I&#039;m going to start a practice log for my flute immediately. And for the bass when I get it...hope it gets here sooner.
By the way, I&#039;m in the &quot;States&quot;, Santa Fe, New Mexico @ 7,000 feet altitude! Practicing the flute can be dizzying but the bass will ground me good. Peace.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great Video Scott... Man you really get it and that&#039;s what I dig the most ... you really want others to get it... therefore you talk about the important things that other (so called) educators don&#039;t... you really know how to attain what you talk about which you constantly demonstrate overtime you play Great Great Job and looking forward to the next video. But for now i need to focus in on those core concepts (which I have been doing) and getting that log book together                                   Stay Well My Friend                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            madden]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this great video, you make me feel much more motivated, I&#039;ve been playing for 12 years, and the 3 first years I had a professor and my improving were amazing, after that because of my job and my band I stopped studing bass and music, although I didn&#039;t stop playing. And my progression stopped. The last months I am studying again with your help and my motivation and I&#039;m really happy again about my improvement.https://disqus.com/verify

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott.  I have been curious and interested about bass for a long time (more than 20 years) but had never really started studying the thing until I discovered your site a few months ago.  Now, after playing guitar for 20+ years and drums for 10 years more than that, I have bought my very first bass and amp, and am following your lessons to learn how to play, really learn.  I&#039;ve been self-taught throughout, and being able to review basic elements of technique, posture, chords, arpeggios, is proving to be an eye opener.  So, thank you massively.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am 68 years old and have loved music of all genres all my life. I began the Bass 3 years ago because I liked how it made me feel and I thought it might be one of the easier instruments to learn this late in life. I took lessons from a guitarist teacher only because there was no Bass Teacher within my area. I learned very little in those first two years. I moved a year ago to an area that has a qualified Bass Teacher and have taken weekly lessons for the last 9 months. The one thing I still struggle with is a well defined outline of what to practice in starting out. I&#039;ll put the time in....if I have an outline (game plan) of what are the first month&#039;s &#039;building blocks&#039;. I feel sometimes that I am one of those students that just bounce around the universe each time Insit down to practice. Many thanks for your incredible website! You are definitely a great teacher and inspirater.]]></description>
