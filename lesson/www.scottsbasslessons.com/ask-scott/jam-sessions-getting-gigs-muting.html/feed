		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott.  I listen to anything and everything. I search Google and U-Tube for bass players, bass solos etc. If there&#039;s a bass tone or line I really like, it goes onto high rotation and I copy it. Recent additions include, Chelsea Rodgers - Prince, Seven Days In Sunny June - Jamiroquai, Lovely Day - Bill Withers,  Smooth - Santana, Trippin&#039; - Lucy Pearl.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My question is about designing a practice routine for bass, in comparison with the practice routine for a lead instrument.  Personally I started out playing trumpet, then moved to guitar.  Of course a lead player has to practice arpeggios, scales, technique etc. But at least in my experience, the cornerstone of my practice routine has always been running through the set list.  This is not even mentioned in your video on how and what to practice.  Typically a rhythm part will have stretches that are either very simple, or just playing time, or even just resting, and an end-to-end recitation of the entire set list would be a waste of time.  How do you prepare specific material for gigs, and how is that incorporated into your practice routine?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To answer your question Scott, I was watching a Larry Graham video on you tube (Somebody on linkedin posted a link on a discussion) and since I thought he was absolutely fantastic (Bass and Vocal) I headed over to Amazon and ordered a box set of five albums from his Graham Central Station band.  So next week I&#039;ll be mostly listening to that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, I have a mac, and was I like to record videos of me playing along with the song... I have tried Movie Maker, and at the same time using GargeBand to create the track but the marrying the two together is a nightmare... Do you have any suggestions on how to make this easier?
For instance, I don&#039;t need my voice to be heard at all.. I just want to include the song I am playing along with, and me playing bass (at a slightly higher level)... In &quot;play along&quot; videos I have done in the past, I have always had the ambient mic picking up my bass amp, phone ringing, dog barking... any suggestions on making it slightly more professional???]]></description>
