		<description><![CDATA[QUESTION?: The other day I was singled out for playing behind the beat. I didn&#039;t know I was there! I was just playing what I feel. Problem was, they didn&#039;t WANT me there. Is a metronome the solution? I am also a drummer, so I use one when I practice my rudiments, but I&#039;m not sure I would know how to push the beat, or be able to tell if I was being successful. Any clues?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I accompany several guitarists who use capos, move capos mid-song, or forget they have a capo on at the first fret!! I sometimes struggle to figure out which key they are playing in - drives me nuts!!. Have you any advice or tips to prevent embarrassing moments similar to your triad experience?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott. I am very new to bass and love everything that you post. I have joined the academy but am having some problems. My old hands do not like the scale length of the Music Man Sub Bass that I bought. I don&#039;t expect miracles mate, just to enjoy myself... So, Question: Do ypu have any opinon of or experience with the KALA U-BASS series. These look like a ukulele, and have a very short scale length (about 20&quot;) They have really fat Polyurethane strings. They sound great, but I don&#039;t want to make (yet another...) dodgy purchase. LOL. Check &#039;em out on YouTube.

Thanks Scott :-) Keep it all coming, it&#039;s great even if most is way beyond me, I just love your musicality.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What do you think about playing/practicing with a U Bass ... those ultra small acoustic electric basses with ruberized strings? I travel a lot and it would be really handy to bring that along to get some extra practice in when I couldn&#039;t bring my regular bass, but I wonder whether spending time with such a small fretboard might affect learning my regular bass (am still a beginning bass player) ...]]></description>

I&#039;m thinking more for medium sized rooms, with or without PA support.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott, I&#039;m wondering if you&#039;re in support of bass players using the Nashville Number System (NNS) in order for them to 1) understand the function of each chord, and 2) to help them in song memorization. Since I&#039;ve begun creating NNS chord charts of tunes, I find I understand them better. Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First &#124; Thanks, Scott for sharing so many of your video bass lessons. Very informative, lots of great performance tips &#038; insights.  Question  &#124;  (You may have covered this in a previous lesson or Q&#038;A clip, but, ) Why do you wear the glove on your left hand &#038; what&#039;s it made of? Advantages / disadvantages? I just had to see for myself and practiced a few times wearing an inexpensive child&#039;s knit glove, stretched tight. Seemed to reduce considerable string scratching &#038; fret noise. Also made those quick little, &quot;Jaco&quot;, vibrato slides (glissandos?) easier and cleaner. Do you mind going into the history, motives and practical aspects behind your left hand glove?]]></description>
