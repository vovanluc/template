		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott - Thanks for sharing these videos -  In ask Scott Episode #10 when you talk about how to learn the notes on a bass  there is an error message that comes up at 11.51 min into the video and it stops, saying &#039;an error has occurred,please try later&#039; . I&#039;ve tried to access it on a different laptop and the same thing happens. Am I the only one with this problem?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t say this is necessarily right, but I struggled with this for a while too, before deciding that using the &quot;right finger&quot; was more of a guideline than a rule. Now I use my first finger on the root and second finger on the fourth for those tricky parts, and then move back to second finger on the root position when that part of the song is over.


In my mind, if it sounds better to do it wrong and doesn&#039;t hurt you, it&#039;s okay to break the rules of the technique gods for a second to get the job done..... within reason of course. ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So, now that I&#039;ve watched the video(and another very fine one it is!), do other people have &quot;landmarks&quot; on the fretboard for finding notes?  Obviously, the dotted frets are there for a reason, but I think I don&#039;t know all of them as a &quot;primary instinct&quot;.  What I mean is, for example, I know that if I want to play E on the A string, I know that it&#039;s the 7th fret, but what I&#039;m looking for is &quot;two frets up from 5th fret&quot;. Despite the dot on 7, I find the 5th fret much more identifiable at a glance.  It&#039;s my landmark.(so is the 12th , and 3rd frets).  


Also, I am a little slow working in reverse: instead of knowing I want an E, I know I want the 7th fret on the A string?  I have to reason out &quot;well, it&#039;s the A string, so 5 is D, and that makes 2 half-steps up an... E!&quot;. This doesn&#039;t come up in playing so much. It&#039;s more of for watching other people to figure out what they are doing.


My point is neither of these are instant recall.  Calculations and adjustments take just a little bit of time.

So my question is, does anyone else do this &quot;zeroing in&quot; and/or math and do you feel it slows you down?
And what do you do about it?  I&#039;ve been doing exercises burn it into my brain but all it seems to do is reinforce my existing ideas because I&#039;m just using them over an over again, or I don&#039;t know where to start!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d love to see some exercises for this too, I&#039;ve found this tricky for years. Never been sure whether to hold down the string at both frets with the flat of the index finger (like a bar chord on guitar) or to move the tip of the index finger up to the next string (which I struggle to do without a noticeable gap in the sound).

Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, yet another great lesson! ;p

However I was wondering if there was a way to improve my fretting hand rolling technique on bass?
I have the basic idea down and find it quite easy on guitar, but I think it is a lot more difficult on bass due to the string thickness.
I mainly struggle with alternating between the root note and fourth with my index finger, a movement found a lot in Soul and Motown. 
It would be a great help if you could show us some exercises to really nail this technique.
Thanks and keep up the good work!!!
