		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott! I have a followup question on hand stretches and technique. I am recently experiencing some left wrist pain and it seems to be due to my playing. After research, I gather that apparently I need to really keep my wrist straight. The pain hasn&#039;t fully gone away after trying to do that but it seems that it&#039;s been helping. But the issue is that keeping my wrist straight limits my technique quite a bit (many more shifts for instance as you mentioned in this episode). I have noticed that your left wrist is usually not very straight (I think I used to bend my wrist as much as you do) so I was wondering if there is something you do to prevent the pain. It will be great if you can generally comment on this whole bent vs. straight wrist issue. 

Thank you very much!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[( I may have re-posted this by accident, apologies if I did)


Scott, thanks so much for putting so much time and effort into all of this. It&#039;s great to see so many people benefiting from your wisdom!


My question is what advice can you give to somebody who wants to become a solo bass player and create songs just for bass guitar? I know so many solo acoustic artists that are amazing but I have never seen a solo bassist and as somebody who loves to write their own songs and express themselves artistically I really want to try and break into that market. What approach will I need to take to my bass playing in order to achieve this?

Cheers!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recently send out a bass-amp-questionnaire to the worldwide bass playing community. To find out exactly what players are using and why. Some interesting results there! Ampeg, Fender and Gallien Krueger are the top 3 of most used bass amps, probably with good reason, so check them out if looking for something new. Markbass, Aguilar and Eden are definitely worth some listening to as well.
You can check the full results of the questionnaire here:

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, JFYI: MarkBass combos essentially amp + speaker, packed. So you always can either daisy-chain it with another speaker or disconnect internal and connect to external speakers as is. Myself I own one cab with 300W at 8 Ohm with 12&quot; and horn inside, which can go 500W at 4 Ohm. So if you connect either MarkBass Traveller speaker or any other from their brand to get 4 Ohm, then you get 500W and it will really blow away and you should be careful! For example, I was using 30 Hz at low B to massage listener&#039;s guts. These frequencies are also moving chairs in the big hall for 500 people and folks on the stage asked me why the cab is causing earthquakes. :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott! Yeah, lessons on social media would be great! It would be really helpful, cause once you&#039;ve learned to play the instrument (or at least got to grips with it), the &quot;reality&quot; starts - you/your band needs to build a fan base and you need to let the people know that you exist, that your music/lessons are cool, etc.. :) Great videos, great info! Cheers, Valters]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott. I need to get into transcribing. I haven&#039;t done any and rely on my teacher who breaks down a song simply or I get printed tab and notation from books or sometimes use songsterr which isn&#039;t 100%. I want to get into a band but I&#039;m put off by a big set list coming through. I like to do a song 90 % plus accurately but teach with 30 years experience says it isn&#039;t necessary and to break it down simply. What&#039;s the best way of getting transcribing under my belt and learning songs very quickly to move on up to gigging :-) thanks Scott]]></description>
