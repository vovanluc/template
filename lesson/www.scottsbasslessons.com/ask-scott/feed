<p>Ok, you might have guessed it - the number 1 question I get asked over and over is...</p>
<p><em>"Why do you wear the glove?!"</em></p>
<p>There are a whole load of questions I get surrounding it...</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it change the tone or sound?</li>
<li>Does it feel different?</li>
<li>Should I try wearing one?</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I thought it was time to tell you the full story.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<h2>Questions During This Episode...</h2>
<p><strong>1. </strong>What do you personally do to expand your bass line and soloing vocabulary on bass?</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">2. </strong>Scott, can you elaborate on your composition process.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">3. </strong>Did teaching bass improve your own skills in anyway?</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">4. </strong>How about inverting double stops or sliding chords (perhaps in higher positions on the neck?)</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">5. </strong>When and why did you decide to share your knowledge on YouTube? What was/is the personal story behind Scott’s Bass Lessons as a learning platform and when did you recognise that things started happening?</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/chords-course-launch" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;&gt; Check out the new course - "Playing Chords on Bass - The Definitive Guide".</a></h2>
<p>===</p>
<h2>Questions During This Episode...</h2>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Any thoughts about tools for building fretless technique, using a four or five strings bass?<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Could you elaborate more in your approach to your plucking hand, mainly showing if there are any differences in your technique from playing live to when you practice - for example, do you prefer using a lighter touch with a louder amp in a live situation.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>You always seem to be jolly! Do you ever get upset or annoyed?!</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>I was wondering, you have created <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">The Academy </a>now, but where did you learn how to play bass? Did you go to a conservatoire? And if so, where?</p>
<p><strong>5. </strong>I'm a 13 year old bass player and play for two churches right now. Do you have any tips for young musicians? How do you freely improvise without messing up?<strong><br />
</strong></p>

<h2>Questions During This Episode...</h2>
<p><strong>1.</strong> How do I get the ball rolling when it comes to meeting other musicians and <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/scotts-backstage-bonuses-area/bass-toolkit-killer-gigs" target="_blank">getting more gigs</a>?<br />
<strong>2. </strong>I’ve got a constant ringing in my ears. How can we <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-tips/protecting-hearing.html" target="_blank">protect our hearing</a>?<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Do you use a different bass live than when you’re in the recording studio?<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Sometimes I get stuck in my practice routines and don’t know what to practice to expand my workout. Is there and idea practice schedule you would recommend to intermediate level players?<br />
<strong>5. </strong>What’s your opinion on both floating thumb or anchoring? I see a lot of funky guys and they all use floating thumb, so I’m assuming there’s something else to it that just personal comfort?<strong><br />
