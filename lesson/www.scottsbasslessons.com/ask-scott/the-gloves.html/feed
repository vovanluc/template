		<description><![CDATA[Always wondered about the glove.  Found the link to this in the 2016 rollup email.  Seems you have found a way to get around the obstacle, appreciate you sharing a personal item after so many requests. Nice place there and family...  Thank You for helping me learn bass - just started in 2016.  All the best to you Scott, the family and the crew for 2017!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott, it&#039;s good you&#039;ve found something to alleviate the symptoms so you can continue to do what you love to do.  Just curious if the kids could ever possibly experience these symptoms to some degree later on in their lives?  Thanks for all your expertise!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scottie... Regards from Saltillo, Mexico.. Sorry to hear about your disease. Hope you are feeling fine. I got to tell you something. Since I saw you wearing the left hand glove, now its part of my gear every where I go.... I notice some benefits in my performance using it. 1.- Your hand is warm at all time. 2.- Your strings are free from dust and moisture, so they last longer. 3.- Less noise when you play. 4.- Increases your speed. 5.- Protects your fingers from blisters and cuts. And the best of all.... it´s a great tribute for you my dear Master and friend..    I recommend using it at all time. Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not listened to the video yet but thanks to Scott and purchasing a pair from him a while back it saved me. My fretting hand would twist up in a ball while playing and wearing the glove stopped it. I did find another kind that had no tips and is thinner that works perfect also. It is a crafters glove if you live in the States you can get at Joanne&#039;s Fabric. I wish I started wearing it 35 years ago. Not only does it help the medical issues it also allows for faster playing especially during those really hot days on stage since your hand doesn&#039;t stick to the neck. 
THANKS SCOTT, without asking you about it my days off playing would be over. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,
Thanx for this video it opens my eyes a little in terms of time management,I waste way too much of it on the TV.But I have a question that has just emerged among my braincells.What methodology do you use for recording videos or how it originally started?I&#039;m sure now having so many videos released you&#039;re experienced a lot and it goes smoothly without much prep and thinking,but what originally you were doing to talk talk to the camera,having no audience behind it?People often tend to be discouraged,distracted and scared when the rec button is on is there any specific approach that you jse,or it&#039;s just natural talent to perform in the eye of the camera?

Best regards,
Igor]]></description>
