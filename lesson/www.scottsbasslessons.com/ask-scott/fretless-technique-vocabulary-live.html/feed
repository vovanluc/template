		<description><![CDATA[Actually, on fretless technique question, there is still one thing that might really be helpful for the tone. When you press string on the neck, on fretless try to press with the finger pad (flat), not with the finger tip as typically it is, and try plucking string closer more to the neck. It gives you much warmer, softer sound with that typical &quot;waaaah&quot; aftertone, which frettles mostly is for. Having pressing strings with a finger tip and picking strings near the bridge gives you that typical &quot;snuffing&quot; nasal Jaco Pastorius&#039;s sound, which is also needed sometimes.

Hope this helps.]]></description>
