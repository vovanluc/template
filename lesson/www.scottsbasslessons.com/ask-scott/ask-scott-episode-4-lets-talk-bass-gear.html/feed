		<description><![CDATA[Hi man! I posted this question on a very old thread so I&#039;ll pop it up again here, since we&#039;re talking gear ;-)
I really liked how you used an octaver on a parallel loop to get back some low end after all the signal processing. (I don&#039;t know if you still do that, but I definitely saw you DID, at some point! :P )
That might just be what I was looking for. One thing, though... I assume that on SOME tunes you will be using no effects at all, right? So no low end loss. Do you STILL keep the parallel octaver running, even when there&#039;s probably no need to beef up the lows?

Thanks, man! ^_^
Cheers!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, love the lessons. Just about to rationalise my basses as live gigs are a now bit scarse. So the question is I would like to buy one really nice bass from the proceeds of selling my current basses, 4 or 5 string, bolt on or neck through, any advice please?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott!
I&#039;m loving the &quot;Ask Scott&quot; videos!
Do you have any tips for playing chords on the bass? When I try to play them, they sound really muddy and it seems to be 90% the bass note of the chord and 10% everything else. Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi scott, how are you?
Do you think active Fender basses are the best active basses around? if so, why?
Also, do you know of any good active basses that are not too expensive?]]></description>
