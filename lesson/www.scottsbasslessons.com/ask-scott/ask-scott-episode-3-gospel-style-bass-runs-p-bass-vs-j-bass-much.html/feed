 Can a good bassist save the band although with a very normal,less advanced skill experience drummer?
Can a good bassist perform well with a bad drummer? 
Explain the relationship between the drummer with the bassist in a band]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott! 
Chris here from Malaysia :)

My question is:
If you can only have one effect pedal as your first effect pedal for now,what type of effect pedal you prefer? (Except tuner pedal)
And also,what&#039;s the second one?:)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Re: Getting Through the Plateaus...
Scott, I totally agree with your theory on plugging through the plateaus!  We all experience them, but it is the determination and dedication that will get you through to the next improvement marker.  I love your idea of working out bass lines for the music that inspires you at the moment and would add that I will work out new bass lines for the songs that I&#039;m playing at the moment, even if I don&#039;t use them in a gig.  Knowing that you are working out new lines for yourself and not your band can let you experiment with new and different sounds...and in turn may begin to influence your type of playing in the long run.]]></description>
