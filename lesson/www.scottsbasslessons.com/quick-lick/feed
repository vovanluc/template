<p>I was geeking out the other day on YouTube and ended up finding a great video of Michael League from the band Snarky Puppy (awesome bass player if you haven't heard him already!).</p>
<p>Only a few seconds into the video Michael played a lick that just "popped out" for me... I grabbed my bass, got it down, and then thought - I've got to create a new 'Quick Lick' lesson for you guys so you can get this lick into your bag too!  </p>
<p>The lick is based on a D major type groove, but Michael super imposes an E7 moving to an A7 over the D major tonality which creates a II V I movement over the static chord. </p>
<p>The end result - a killer sounding lick!  </p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Have you ever played a great solo line where the notes just jump out at you and sound super cool? </p>
<p>Well, a lot of the time those notes are either extensions of the chord that the soloist is playing over, such as 9ths, 11ths and 13ths, or they're alterations of those extensions, such as #5's, b9's/#9's, #11's and b13s. </p>
<p>In this new Quick Lick lesson, you're going to learn a really cool lick that's based on a Lydian-type tonality and utilises the #11, but also throws a #5 and a nice chromatic line into the mix to spice things up a little.   </p>
<p>By learning this lick you're going to be able to see how solo lines are actually constructed using elements such as chord tones and scales, which in turn is going to really help you when it comes to constructing your own lines and riffs. </p>
<p><strong>And remember</strong> - if you're an Academy member you also get instant access to a full analysis video too, where I strip the lick down piece by piece and discuss the exact theory behind it, so you can start applying it to your own solos. </p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<p>Hey, Scott here…</p>
<p>Because of the all amazing feedback we received about the last two “Quick Riff” lessons I published, I thought I’d try another one in a similar format… but this time it’s a “Quick Lick”. </p>
<p>Now just a word of warning… this ‘Quick Lick’ is a tough one, so if you’re more of an advanced player you’re going to love it!</p>
<p>If you’re not an advanced player, don’t worry - you can still learn something from this lesson.</p>
<p>The lick itself is over a Cm7 tonality, but I want you to pay close attention to how many notes within this lick are ‘not’ contained within the Cm7 chord. Essentially they are what would be considered wrong notes, but what you’ll find is that they still work.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>… Because of tension and release. </p>
<p>I can play what would be considered ‘wrong notes’ within a line or lick, as long as I resolve them correctly. Now don’t get me wrong, there is method behind the madness - I’m not just playing any old note and hoping for the best. Every single note is there for a reason, even if it’s not within the Cm7 tonality. </p>
<p>Ok, you ready? </p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott 😄 </p>
<p>PS. Just a quick thank you for all the emails coming in asking about the new magazine we’re launching in July. I’ve been talking a lot about it on Snapchat over the last few weeks… and there’ll be more info to come, so keep a look out. If you’re not following me on Snapchat yet - my user name is “SBL1000”   </p>
