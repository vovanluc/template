				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What can I say… the response I’ve had from the last two solo bass singles that I released has completely blown me away!</p>
<p>Collectively the two singles have had over 20,000 views in just the last month!…</p>
<p>My mind is blown! :)</p>
<p>Because of the overwhelming feedback i’ve received from you guys, I decided it was about to time to get back in the shed (my favourite place!) and get to work on another solo bass single for you.</p>
<p>This new solo single is based on the song “My Favourite Things” from the Rogers and Hammerstein musical The Sound of Music - although my version is quite different from the original as you’ll find out.</p>
<p>I used my Overwater 5 string signature bass strung E-C, and went direct into the desk.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy this one… let me know what you think in the comments below the video.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott.</p>
<p>PS. If you haven't check out the last two solo bass singles I release, you can check them out here...</p>

<li><a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/live-sessions/scotts-solo-bass-sessions-autumn-leaves.html">Autumn Leaves.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>PPS. I mentioned a few weeks back that I’ve had more emails than I can count asking whether i’d be creating a specific course covering how to play chords on the bass, and how I approach arranging solo bass pieces like the one you’re about to listen too…</p>
<p>The great news is that… YES I AM! :) In fact, the first module is already filmed and is in the editing process as I type. The course will be getting released into the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy/online-bass-courses">Academy course library</a> in just a few weeks time… so keep a look out! If you’re not already an Academy member - <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">check it out here</a>. It’s AWESOME! :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had 10 minutes before recording the next Bass Riff Of THe Week, so I decided to throw down a quick groove for you...</p>
<p>What's the composition?... Well I figured it'd be pretty boring if I was just grooving, so I came up with this little melody off the top of my head... hence why this tune is called "Off The Cuff" ;)</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I received such a great response from my first solo arrangement for bass, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/live-sessions/scotts-solo-bass-sessions-smile-charlie-chaplin.html">"Smile"</a> by Charlie Chaplin, that I decided it was time to release another single...</p>
<p>This is my solo rendition of Autumn Leaves by Johnny Mercer.</p>
<p>I'm a huge fan of this song and recommend all my students learn to play it as it's a great way to <em>dip your toe</em> into the world of jazz. Unfortunately because so many students use it as one of their first study pieces it has been labelled as a jazz standard that is only played by beginners, and that's really unfortunate as it's such a beautiful song. This was the reason I picked it as my next solo arrangement - to show that it can be performed in many ways, and is certainly not "just for beginners".</p>
<p>It was recorded on my signature Overwater 5 string, strung E-C, direct into the desk using the neck pickup only.</p>
<p>You can also download this single totally free too. All I ask for in payment is… good karma! But if you really want to help me out, I’d love it if you passed this single on or forwarded a link to this video to anyone you thought might enjoy it!</p>
<p>See you in the shed!</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. I’ve received a ton of email since the <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/live-sessions/scotts-solo-bass-sessions-smile-charlie-chaplin.html">first single</a> was released asking whether I’d ever be creating a course covering how to play chords on the bass and how to master chordal arrangement. Well… the simple answer is… yes I will!</p>
<p>I’ll be releasing a full course covering chords into <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">The Academy</a> at the end of November. If you’re already an Academy member this course will be added to your membership automatically as soon as it’s released. If you’re not already a member… <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">shoot over here and check out The Academy</a> for yourself.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the third single I've released with my Project-Live band. As always it was recorded live in the studio, there were no rehearsals previous to this date, we just ran through the chart a few times so we all felt comfortable with it, then hit the record button and hoped for the best!</p>
<p>I’ve had the entire session filmed so you can sit back and enjoy a real live band in the comfort of your own home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last time I released a single the feedback was simply amazing... I was totally blown away. But, can you guess what everyone asked for in the next single?... you guessed it, a bass solo!</p>
<p>So in this single release... there's a bass solo for you! ;)</p>
<p>What's 'Project-Live' all about?...</p>
<p>None of the singles I release will have had any pre-rehearsals. The concept is to get musicians together that have never played together before, hand out some music, run through the piece a few times and then hit record.</p>
<p>You can also download this single totally free too. All I ask for in payment is... good karma! But if you <em>really</em> want to help me out, I'd love it if you passed this single on or forwarded a link to this video to anyone you thought might enjoy it!</p>
