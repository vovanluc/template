		<description><![CDATA[First I found it ridiculous that you meant it seriously teach us the C major scale!! But then the comments on yt proved to me not everybody knows about these absolute basics. So, good lesson after all, this surely helped many people. Sorry for me being biased.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,

I am a guitar player and am starting to learn how to play the bass. With respect to playing the major scale on bass, why do you start with your first finger and then slide up from there? Why not start with your second finger on the root, as doing so would make it possible to play the scale without having to slide?

Cheers,
Adam]]></description>
