		<description><![CDATA[Hello Miki.  This lesson is a bit more advanced and assumes that the student knows quite a bit.  I can follow it because I downloaded Scott&#039;s Major and Minor 2-5-1 modules, which taught me about chord progressions and simple improvisation.  Then I got the Jazz Blues one and worked through that.  I took tiny little steps and over about a year the little steps added up to the point where I can follow what Scott is doing in this lesson.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is very good for me Scott.  I turn up to open-mic jazz nights and found that my solos became stereotyped - always running up the chord tones and down scales, or the other way round - but this is helping me break out of that and become more melodic.  Two thumbs up!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As usual, Scott&#039;s clearly articulated a brilliant idea. 

I have been working on solo jazz guitar and was kind of heading towards that just because it&#039;s necessary to chord or do a little walking bass from time to time to keep the groove going and give the listener and myself a break. Bass, though, works really well for this too. It makes things feel like they&#039;re breathing to go back to more simple walking so that the groove stays alive. I&#039;ve been playing a lot of bass recently and found that that this happened in soloing, too, but I kind of thought I was wrong to do it! 

I got to play bass in a sax trio (tenor sax, bass, drums) for a few songs yesterday, which was great for this, I just didn&#039;t know what I was doing! 

I could even see getting good enough at this and accompanying a singer or a solo instrument like a sax on just a bass... eventually. ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My pleasure! Even if most of the topics you cover, I already know them cold, I still watch a lot of your videos for the way you explain stuff! And (last but not least!) when you throw in a phrase or a lick to demonstrate what you&#039;ve been talking about, THAT&#039;S when the tasty stuff comes up! And that&#039;s what I&#039;m after! ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Think of it like an F7 but move the root note up one semitone, leaving the rest of the notes where they are. If you play an F7 arpeggio then play it again with an F# instead of the F, you`ll recognise it, gives a nice bit of movement too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is possibly the best lesson yet. Other favorites include the Pino double stop and the Jaco-y groove with all the 16ths. This one helped a lot though, as up until now I didn&#039;t even use many memorized licks; I&#039;d just sort of hear something fitting and go for it while barely thinking about the chord tones. It&#039;s worked well on tunes with slower changes, but now I&#039;ve got another great (and super pragmatic) trick in my bag. Thanks Scott!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, I&#039;m chuckling now because in the month or so that I have been here I found out about right hand technique and why it&#039;s important, I learned truths about how other instruments fit in to a mix that I had not really considered before, and in general find myself gasping for air as I work on putting it together for the 3-5 live gigs I play per week. Not complaining, these are all good things that are taking me to a whole new level as both a bass player and musician in general. I have said it here before, this is a really great resourse you have put together and I am thankful that I found it. Thank you! :))]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott,
This is the best bass lesson ever.  Because it is not as simple as it seems, and it forces you to look at what you are doing when you solo, and then get into a groove.  And such a great standard progression.  I mean I always just play the notes in the diminished scale, but soloing over it is a great challenge.  Thanks for the eye opener!
