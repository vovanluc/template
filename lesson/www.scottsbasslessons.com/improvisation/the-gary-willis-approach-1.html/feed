		<description><![CDATA[Kind of... but he doesn&#039;t think of it like that. He just thinks of the pentatonic as a substitution over whatever chord he&#039;s playing over and knows that different substitutions will bring out different extensions over each chord. Gary is a very &#039;practical player&#039;, as in, he&#039;s not really into doing brain gymnastics - he just uses what he needs to, to get the job done. Hope that helps man. Scott ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So, Scott, If I may.. Please correct me if I am wrong, and forgive my explanation being quite laymen.... But, basically what he (Gary) is doing is, MODES.. but MODES in Pentatonic forms... Correct? 

Just looking for other ways to make sure I have this locked in... If I&#039;m correct I have already been doing this for a wile without knowing it was someones &quot;style&quot; already. :p Much love, and Respect... Sara]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A bit of a smartass observation :) :

Isn&#039;t the whole thing like playing Eb major ionian or the root major, without the 4th grade, the a (Bb major pentatonic and Eb major pentatonic combined are like a normal Eb major scale without the a, which is the 4th)?

Or, to put it simpler, over a minor chord you can play the root major (ionian) scale without the 4th in it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott I found your website as I was tearing down and rebuilding the theory I have learned over the last 30 years. This includes a ton of modal work. Something you may find interesting, I vastly ignored pentatonics in the past, even being a rock musician, as I viewed it as &quot;cheating&quot; on the various modes.  I came name many players who use pentatonics exclusively and may not even know they are doing so or why the work.
I guess if they are good enough for you and Gary Willis they are good enuff for me !! LMFAO
Anyhow I will stay tuned and promote the site.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,

Tnx for this usefull info. I guess this works best when it&#039;s Dorian right (at least not all minor like modes)

Cheers Anton]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yep that&#039;s it. But... If I were you I get used to viewing them from the actual chord not the related Major chord... it&#039;ll make things easier in the long run and stop you having to do brain gymnastics ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,

You mentioned a second lesson on the use of pentatonics over Blue Bossa. When do you expect to do this lesson? Would love to dive into that lesson

warm regards, groet
Jorg]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,

Great lessons with great explanation. I&#039;m still trying to work out whats going on here only being a grade 5 !!

Ok at 18:12 mins in your talking about 9th&#039;s and 11th&#039;s of the Cmin. Well I have a bit of a problem with minor keys and find myself always having to base my thinking from majors. So is the 9th and the 11th of Cmin really just the maj 7th (D) and the maj 2nd (F) of E flat Maj ??

Thanks in advance

David]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott,
Thanks for yet another educational lesson.  I am hooked. I am on your site every day looking for new insights to the music puzzle to work into my practice. I will pass along your tutorials with praise to my musician mates.

Sincerely,
Rory]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, great stuff.

However it tells me to go back and learn to play the major pentatonic all over the neck.

Thanks!]]></description>
