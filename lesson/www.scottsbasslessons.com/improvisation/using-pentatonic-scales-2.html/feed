		<description><![CDATA[Scott
Fantastic, being new to bass I love the way you construct then deconstruct the riff and show that you can take just a small bit of it and use it here and there and it sounds great. I have a bit of trouble thinking outside the box and this sort of lesson opens up so many ideas that i would never have thought of.
Also I find understanding the music easier than I thought I would, being an ex-drummer, as you explain it so well.
Very inspiring 
Thanks
P.S. When i can spare a quid it is coming your way (still paying off my bass at present)

		<description><![CDATA[hey Scott, big fan from Brazil, here.
Just want to know: you appear to always use the chords from your demonstrations without the fifth; I&#039;ve heard that this is usually what it takes to construct chords since the fifth grade is more alike an addendum, at least on a bass guitar approach is that right?]]></description>
