		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott, I know and understand the importance of feedback. Its the only way we can move things in better directions in my opinion. I just hate giving negative feedback, when I do give it I always try to be respectful and constructive. Thank you for receiving it in the spirit intended.

One other suggestion for the video is if you can increase audio levels about 3db it would make the discussion easier to hear and follow in this particular interview and/or others made in a similar manner.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey James thanks for the feedback. As you can imagine it&#039;s hard to get the full picture from this snippet as the full interview is over an hour long. The full interview has got great direction, but maybe this wasn&#039;t captured in this video - as always, it&#039;s a learning curve for me into what works and what doesn&#039;t which is why feedback from you guys is super important. There&#039;s no other way for me to find out other than just doing it and seeing what works. Maybe for future videos like this I&#039;ll make them longer so you get more of a feel for it. 

Thanks again, Scott :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Geoff and Scott, I really wasn&#039;t impressed with the snipet of the interview. I know that you would like this to help drive SBL Academy subscriptions, but the lack of value from my perspective in this interview in no way encourages me to consider trying out the academy. I know this isn&#039;t the feedback you would like to receive, its not in anyway meant to be personal. The interview was not well directed or planned from my perspective. Zoltan certainly was able to get his points across, but there should have been a more thoughtful direction in leading the interview toward more examples of execution and maybe there is more in the full interview. However, I don&#039;t get that from this snipet.

Scott, I love your site and what you do for the bass playing community of the world. This video just doesn&#039;t do justice to what you normally present here. Sorry.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Lownote, I completely agree about the &#039;mmms&#039;....I hadn&#039;t realised I was doing it, but will be sure to cut them out in future. Thanks for watching, Cheers Geoff]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Geoff, good and very useful interview. But can you do less interjecting?  I know you&#039;re trying to encourage the guy but he&#039;s quite confident enough as it is and your constant &#039;mmms&#039; just get in the way.   His English isn&#039;t brilliant and your interjections make it more difficult to catch what he says.]]></description>
