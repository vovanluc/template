		<description><![CDATA[Congratulations for the 100th lesson! All of them quality lessons, indeed. I love that sound of the Major seventh over a minor chord. That &quot;harmonic minor scale&quot; hint creates a kind of crispy tension that resolves beautifuly to the root of the Cmin chord! Thank you for your devotion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hey scott, quick suggestion, when you play a line, count off first so we can start together. 
I like to play along with the licks, but you&#039;re like &quot;ready, set, go&quot; and off before I can start with you. It&#039;d be a lot easier if you do a proper count off.


Love the lessons, you are the BEST!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow Scott another great lesson.  Have you ever given thought to private lessons via Skype?  The lessons could be prepaid through paypal.  It would be awesome to be able to do that.  Thank for all you and Geoff do to make the Academy the greatest Bass resourse and teaching center I have evere encountered.  Again Thank You.

		<description><![CDATA[Great lesson, and thank you for all your hard work responding to the needs of your students.  Love everything you&#039;re doing with the community!


This lesson on substitutions will fit quite well into my current practice, because lately I&#039;ve been analyzing substitutions like flat5, flat7, flat9, and sharp11, and figuring out their harmonic reasoning so as to know when they are appropriate to use.


The exercise in this video is really useful method for getting one&#039;s ear used to substitutions.  I was interested by your statement that you don&#039;t think of the technicalities while playing, your training just informs your brain and fingers what is necessary to get out the music line you&#039;re creating in your head.  I find myself that I already have enough of an ear to use substitutions in singing, I just don&#039;t understand what I&#039;m doing as I feel my way to some tasty blue or out-note.  So on bass it&#039;s a matter of hooking up what I&#039;m already creating in my head with where and what it is.  So a listening-playing exercise like this one is similar to what I&#039;m doing with my analysis of jazz tunes gleaned from MIDI scores, wherein I discover substitutions and figure out what the basic harmony is, play the &#039;in&#039; harmony, then play the &#039;out&#039; harmony to train my ear.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Listening to a jazz musician justify an outside choice is a lot like hearing a politician rationalize a deficit.  They&#039;ll try to convince you not only that they meant to do it, but that it was absolutely necessary.

The rest of us have to maintain a household budget, and our nonharmonic tones have to be carefully measured as well.  If you want to stay in the band, that is.  Actually I think the bass is a little more forgiving in that respect than other instruments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome lesson! What about playing &quot;out&quot; over major chords? I suppose you could use a few of the same tricks, but are there any good ones that work particularly well over major chords specifically? Love the videos. Thank you so much for making them!]]></description>
