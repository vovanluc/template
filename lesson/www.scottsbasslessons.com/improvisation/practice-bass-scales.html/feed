		<description><![CDATA[In this video, Scott, you show the major scale from the fourth finger as 4, 1-3-4, 1-2-4,1.
In your &#039;Modes Revealed&#039; course, you show the major scale from the fourth finger as 4, 1-3-4, 1-3, 1-2.
Is the real lesson &#039;don&#039;t get stuck in a single position&#039; and experiment with alternatives?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a beginner, the chicken &#038; egg situation is learning which notes are in each scale (as the sharps/flats change) AND where those notes are on the fretboard.

Does anyone have a recommended good way to learn these notes quickly?  Best to sit with a fretboard chart open &#038; a a list of the notes in the scales that I am practicing?  I guess it should be a couple of weeks &#038; I will have it down that way.  Are there other suggestions?  Cheers!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for helping us beginners out, Scott. These are really great lessons.
One thing I&#039;m thinking about is to get a 5 string bass with an extra high C string. I can see how a low B could confuse me, but when I was practicing to play scales over two octaves, I thought the high C could be very useful especially for beginners. What do you think?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First of all, thanks so much for all I have learned from you! But, I am confused about the progression in lesson 2- for an Aflat major scale isn&#039;t the II-V-I, Bflat-Eflat-Aflat? If so, then where does the C major come in...?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Scott:

Thanks for the great tutorials.  Really the best thing I have seen online.  Aligns well with the way I think I learn music best.  

I am not sure whether this message got through before, so I am trying again.

I notice that in this tutorial, you play the third position scale differently than you did in another tutorial.  IN this case, you play the 7th note on the G string, while in another tutorial you play it on the D string.

I realize this is a good example of flexibility and knowing your way around the fretboard, but I just wondered if you had any comments on when you would choose to play each option--or does it just depend on the song your playing at the time.  Are there any advantages of one over the other in particular situations?  If so, what and when.

Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Mate,

This is awesome! Great lesson!

Is there something similar for the minor scales? I am on the dark side of the force and tend to keep my basslines more in minor scales that in major scales... :)

Let me know where I can find information about minor scales starting with 3 (or 4) different fingers...

Cheers Mate!
