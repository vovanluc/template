		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Scott! This has and continues to help me tremendously in mapping out my scales on bass. Time to move out of the C-only mindset and go through my circle of fourths and fifths (a bit scary even though I know the notes and patterns for them)..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry for joining in so late,
GREAT lesson Scott, thanks for sharing.
I also have an exercise that I find useful to unlock the fretboard,
my buddy a guitarist ;) was talking about it and so I tried it out.

In essence it&#039;s playing scales, modes and arpeggios 
using 4 notes per string, and consecutive fingers (good for stretches too ;))

Scales work out best using a 4 string and a 2 octave scale/mode
repeating the the octave note in the middle when changing between A &#038; D strings.

HTH

Thanks for ALL your great lessons and insights.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is awesome.  Love the gorilla style recording -- the information provided trumps video quality (which is just fine here)!  Imagine doing a major scale a month.  At the end of the year you would really know your majors scales and associated modes.  You would hear the scale not just from root to root which I am guilty of.  Thanks Scott!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[great thing about this .. is its also an introduction to Modes ... anyone wondering what they are.. this is a great exercise to simply explain exactly how easy modes can be.
eg. starting C major from E to E being the E Phrygian :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this Scott.  I definitely need to work on this. I have been working through two other courses from SBL, Technique Deep Dive and Playing Chords on Bass.  I may have to actually sign up for the academy sometime in the near future and work through the 10 hour scale course.  Looking forward to it...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That is just a great lesson for beginners as me, very easy to get all the note names and remember them. Actually for me it is much easier to get, than doing it vertical. One more thing - not discovering America here obviously, but I just get into my memory, that only BC and EF are without a &quot;space&quot;(#, b) on the neck, doing vertical, so it&#039;s even easier for me to remember the note position, going all over the neck - like f.ex. EF_G_A_BC_D_EF_G_A_BC_D_E etc. :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[like this idea, had a little trouble on the e string can&#039;t use my pinky like you on that c note on the 20th fret, have to slid with my third finger up to it. I&#039;m also thinking it wouldn&#039;t hurt to approach chords this way. Great lesson Scott. Thanks!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Ron, saying/thinking the note names when doing the exercise can be a fantastic exercise in itself. I&#039;m actually not thinking of the note names when I&#039;m playing it, and I&#039;m not thinking of whole notes or semi tones either - I&#039;ve learned each scale position so well (I use 3 fingering positions for each scale) that I can see them on one string as I move up and down the fingerboard. I should say though, that isn&#039;t the only way of doing it - thinking of the note names is a great way to do it to, i&#039;m just more of a visual player. Great question by the way!]]></description>
