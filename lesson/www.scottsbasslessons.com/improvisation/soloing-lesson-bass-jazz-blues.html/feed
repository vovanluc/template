		<description><![CDATA[It works due to the fact that the F minor blues scale has some strong chord tones that are also contained within the Bb7 chord. The 5th of Bb7 is F, but the Bb7 is already a dominant chord so technically speaking the Bb7 is in the key on Eb major - therefore the chord built from the 5th of Bb7 would be an F dorian sound - but, you shouldn&#039;t think like that as it&#039;s way over cooking the pudding if you know what I mean. i.e. you&#039;d be over thinking the actually issue. Thanks for watching man :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Paul, F blues scale works as it has some of the string tones in that are associated with the Bb7. The diminished works because the D7 is a D7b9 chord. Thanks for watching man :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There certainly are Robert. The one I&#039;m using in the video is the stripped down version of a jazz blues - whereas the one you&#039;re referring too has a few more II V&#039;s in it. Both are super common and can be used in conjunction with each other. When someone calls a jazz blues on a jam session, it&#039;s rarely discussed which version of the sequence is going to be used - it&#039;s a case of everyone has there ears wide open, and is following each other. In many cases people don&#039;t stick to it strictly either - the first time round they might play a really stripped down version, the second time round they might start throwing in some more chords like the one you mentioned, and so on. Again, this isn&#039;t really discussed though - it&#039;s more a case of knowing and understanding the different options you have, and then either following the other players in the band, or leading the way yourself. In a nutshell, this is why jazz is so special - there&#039;s so many routes of interpretation and much of it is improvised. Definitely exciting! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m very confused....I have the same question as Paul.  Why does the Fm scale played in place of the Bb.  In theory, shouldn&#039;t the fifth of the Bb scale be a F dominant chord?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m now confused, Scott.  In the Jazz Blues package I downloaded rom you the first four bars goes not 

F7 &#124; F7 &#124; F7 &#124; F7 &#124;
but 
C7 &#124; F7 &#124; C7 / Gm7 / C7 &#124;

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott....another great applicable lesson.  Just wonderin.....there&#039;s 2 tunes i&#039;m stumblin on. I remember you offered &quot;teen town&quot; as a study piece a while ago. &quot;Do I Do&quot; (Wonder), and &quot;Birdland&quot; (Weather Report) .....could we, in the future, perhaps pick apart one of these 2 classics a bit?..maybe incorporate one in the &quot;Riff of the Week. or offer one up as a new study piece. Both of these tunes reflect, and tie together, a lot of what you teach in your free lessons...or so I think.. but there is some sections where I drop my compass.. I remember my first bass instructor, in 1981, she said to me..&quot;before we get into to anything, theory and whatnot, tell me a song you really want to know on the bass&quot;. I picked &quot;The Trees&quot; by Rush. After that, I was hooked. You show, and teach a young student a wicked &quot;bass tune&quot; that he/she loves, something that they never thought possible at that stage, and the rest is history...lol   I find SBL  to be as engaging, even at 50..:)
Take Care, and good luck with the new addition to your family!!
From East Coast Canada....Cheers!
Oh and P.S.----I just bought a set of Rotosound Monel Flatwound Standard Jazz Strings.....WOW and OMG !!]]></description>
