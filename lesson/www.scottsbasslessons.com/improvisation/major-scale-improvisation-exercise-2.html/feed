		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott. Why do you wear BLACK gloves sometines? It makes seeing your left hand fingers very hard and in your lesson you move so fast. I am new to your lessons and I hope to get more into how you teach and maybe then I can keep up. I have only been playing bass since 1969 so you would think I would know how by now. BTW, in 1969 I also wore a black glove while playing in a soul band in Muscle Shoals Alabama USA. Great site and thanks for the lessons.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great video! you sound great.

I just can&#039;t get it to sound that melodic.  I&#039;ve been playing for about 10 months and my playing is still choppy, my fingers spaz out and do their own thing on the fretboard!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott, thanks so much for taking the time to make these lessons! They&#039;ve been the most helpful tool I have found as a guitar player transitioning to bass. I&#039;ve been playing music for the past 8 years but You&#039;ve helped me to get a much deeper understanding of it over the past few months. You&#039;ve re-inspired me to put the work in to really progress! I have one question for you though: What bass do you play? I&#039;ve  scoured the web and I just don&#039;t recognize the logo? Thanks again mate!
