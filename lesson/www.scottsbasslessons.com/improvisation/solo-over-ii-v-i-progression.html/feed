		<description><![CDATA[You recommend to play F melodic minor scale on V chord (G7) and also on the I chord (Cmaj7). On the V chord we play A flat and B flat and A and B on the I chord.
As it&#039;s the same scale I don&#039;t understand why different notes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So the substitions offered up here are just melodic minors D, F, and Ab played over the G7. (The 5th, the 7th, and lastly a half step up of the V chord) I&#039;m assuming (Yikes)  this a general rule of thumb that is good for this progression in any key?  Although I still don&#039;t solo very well, I&#039;m trying to picture it in other keys is why I&#039;m asking,  Sometimes it helps to move to another key, get REALLY frustrated, and return to the first key, only to discover I understand it far better than I thought.]]></description>

Playing Kool and Gang was the thing-  Then there ws Jaco, and now you. Im inspired, your tone, sound and musicality are off the wall- That being said i&#039;m going to have to rethink EVERYTHING I do.
 My Fingering are all wrong and i Know it.  Can you get back to me and let me know how I can study with you. and the cost. If I can find a way to have a one on one on line i&#039;d be thankful-

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry it seems like I am commenting on every single one of your videos... But correct me if I&#039;m wrong: The altered scale and superlocrian would be the same thing? And the melodic minor starting a tone down from the root of the chord would Dorian flat9? 

So you can actually play all the substitutions starting on G? 
G Lydian Dominant, G Superlocrian, and Dorian b9 respectively? They are all just modes of the melodic minor scale.

Thanks so much for these lessons! I had no clue that this could be done...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[See... This is the kind of harmonic content I&#039;ve been looking for! I know all of my modes/scales etc... I know Pastorius and other awesome jazz guys don&#039;t stay diatonic in their solos... I&#039;ve never been able to understand all the colour in their playing... Using a D melodic minor over the G7 sounds amazing.. I definitely need to save up some money and get a private lesson... 
Great lessons!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott you are not only an awesome player but a skilled teacher, one of the best I have come across - I have been playing bass for a great many years in all musical genres, but somehow cannot get to grips with jazz improv, despite being a jazz fanatic...your no-nonsence approach has inspired me to become a student again, thank you for your generosity in providing these excellent free lessons! 
A question re your left hand glove, what is your reason for playing with this on, what is the fabric?
...and an observation, unfortunately the black glove fingers on a dark fingerboard make for difficult viewing ;-)
Thank you again for helping new and seasoned bassists alike!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, thanks so much for what you&#039;re doing here, it&#039;s nothing short than amazing.

I&#039;ve been playing bass for a looong time now, I have always been a rock / groove bassist , I can play some jazz too, but I&#039;ve always had this thing: It doesn&#039;t matter how hard I try, when I apply the concepts you graciously and exhaustively explain here, I always lack that peculiar &quot;jazzy&quot; sound.
As a friend of mine would put it, I sound like Geddy Lee playing jazz.
Any advice on how to develop my phrasing? I use the same scales as you do, but somehow I lack that extra &quot;signature&quot; sound.
BTW this is me: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aal4q7T38ho&#038;feature=g-upl
Thanks for again, I&#039;m going to donate soon!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Scott,
   I first saw you on You Tube and really liked your approach. I have been playing electric bass for 30 years . I have better than average reading skills and functional chops to handle any type of gig. I do most of my playing with the Texas Instruments Jazz Band, but cannot wrap my mind around the solo part of playing. You have inspired me to try again. Thank You.
I donated to your site yesterday.

Cheers
Frank LoCrasto]]></description>
