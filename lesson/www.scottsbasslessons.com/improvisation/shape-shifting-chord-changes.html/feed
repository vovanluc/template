		<description><![CDATA[The altered notes are basically all the notes that aren&#039;t in the chord. So if the chord was G7 the chord tones would be - g, b, d, f... the altered tones would be everything except those notes. I know that sounds crazy... all the wrong notes lol! But - there&#039;s a real skill to using those wrong notes and it takes a lot of practice to make it sound convincing. That&#039;s why the minor third up shift works so well - it does the hard work for ya! ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott,  Thanks for the great lessons.  You may have mentioned it during the lesson and I missed it, but why is it that we can shift the pattern up to the minor 3rd and it works?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thx a lot bro ! I replay again my JB´72 for 2 years now and cover with 2-3 bands now in few musical directions, you persuade me to go further in learning ... it´ll take time for sure but what a pleasure to follow you guy. Merci beaucoup pour la motivation. LoVe&#038;GrOOve.
I didn´t already check all the great lessons - One question: are they special lessons using 5 strings bass.
Have a JB V too !
Merci 
Later on]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i like this in principle, but in practice i find voice-leading problems can crop up.  e.g ( in key of C for ex) the F in the iv chord is of course the 7th of the V7, which has more or less got to fall to the 3rd of the tonic chord (i.e. f to e) But this movement is almost certain to be happening in one of the other instruments above the bass, thus we have a perfect trap for not very pleasant side effects like parallel octaves and doubled maj 3rds, and also risks weakening that very powerful bond that is the main point of the perfect cadence  because the note 5 to note one (or in V inversions note 7 or note 2 to note one) movement the gives the cadence its strength   is in danger of turning into the more static feel of a plagal cadence  - albeit with a minor iv chord. how do you suggest maintaining the V-I bond in this situation?

Great stuff. You r a great teacher as even I am able to fathom out what you r imparting. Rather slow I am (57 yrs old now) but your methodical and systematic way of explaining is a real joy and gives me the requisite confidence I have been lacking..........Thanks again! Cheers!]]></description>
