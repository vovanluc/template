		<description><![CDATA[Great lesson. I just have a question how the harmony works for you to get those melodic minor alterations. I get that you go do a minor ii-v-i which give you the Em7b5 and A7. I also understand you go up a minor 3rd to get that G from the Em7b5 and then you go up a half-step from the A7 to get that Bb Melodic minor. But, a simple question is &quot;Why does that work&quot; compared to something else? I guess I&#039;m just trying to understand how that method works harmonically rather than conceptually.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mmmm... Depends what situation you&#039;d were playing, but I&#039;d keep those types of shenanigans to soloing or chordal work really - as when you&#039;re walking there&#039;s gonna be someone else soloing on top of you so you want to give him/her a really solid foundation to layer there substitutions on top of. Saying that - after time you&#039;ll start hearing what the soloist is immplying with there substitutions and then you can join in! Pow! Scott ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott.
Thanks a lot for all your lessons. They&#039;re Great.
One Question: Can I imply a 2-5 with &#039;Melodic Minor Scales&#039; also while Walking, and others are Improvising?  Or would it be to much? :-)

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Alex, yeah I learned the melodic minor from the 1st, 2nd and 4th finger. As far as practicing different scale fingerings... when you have learned the scale from the three different fingers start to try and &#039;see&#039; how they relate to each other. By doing this you&#039;ll be able to come up with many different ways to play the same scale on the fly. Easy man. S]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott,
Great stuff on your website! I really like your super work :D keep it up...
I have a couple of short questions ;) ... Are you also starting melodic minor from your 1st, 2nd and 4th finger, or do you have other fiingerings for melodic minor? Are there any scale patters that you suggest praticing?
Thanks a lot man! 
Alex]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Steve, if your looking for a scale to use over a half diminished chord (which is also known as a minor 7th flat 5 chord) you could use the seventh mode of the major scale which is the Locrian scale. There&#039;s other options but stick with that for now. Easy man. S]]></description>
