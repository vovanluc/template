		<description><![CDATA[You are right man! chord tones and approach notes are the way to go. I am into Charlie Banacos stuff. He was the greatest teacher. Joe Hubbard studied with him. I am bruising my ass learning the stuff because that is what takes one places. Thanks for the free lessons. Joe Hubbard got a free ear training software so check it out. The is also an app on apple . It good have both of them. The ear training method is from Charlie Banacos. It trains you ears to hear chords and notes effortless. Some students of Charlie can hear 12 notes play simultaneously and identify each note with easy. Guys like Joe Hubbard, Jeff Berlin, Mike Stern etc. studied with him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What is a &quot;lick player&quot;? 
According to Victor Bailey:

&quot;Hey meatyout thanks for your comment.I don&#039;t think I have a despicable attitude at all. Please know that I am just as in awe of the Jaco as everyone else.I just don&#039;t get caught in the hype and keep it real.He was a phenomenal presence in music,but a lick player none the less.Licks that changes the world,but still a lick player.

His version of Dolphin Dance is not the best interpretation of those changes that I﻿ ever heard that&#039;s all.I&#039;m still blown away by him though,don&#039;t get me wrong.&quot;

He&#039;s definitely not a lick player: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UZ_iinsXQk

Btw. I didn&#039;t mean &quot;despicable&quot; (I&#039;m french and me not speak english very good). I meant &quot;arrogant&quot; or perhaps &quot;obnoxious&quot; ;-). Great bassist anyway, IMHO. Listen to &quot;Molasses Run&quot; for a good example among many others...

Best,

Francis]]></description>
