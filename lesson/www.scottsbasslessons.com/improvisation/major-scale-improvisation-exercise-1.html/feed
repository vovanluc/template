		<description><![CDATA[Great lessons, Scott! The website design is great for the most part, except that I keep going in circles trying to find the backing tracks. I enter my e-mail address and click &quot;Access Now&quot;, at which point I find myself on an unrelated page. Eventually I navigate back here again, with still no way to access the backing tracks, still being asked to enter my e-mail address. I use Google Chrome.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This lesson is awesome, it has transformed my playing. In two evening I can now comfortable play steadily all over the fret in major scale intervals and tunefully. I just need to fully lock it in, to become totally instinctive.

What really made it click for me was I looked closer at your three positions and plotted them out on paper I realised that if you were able to just keep going across the fret there are three patterns that occur on each string that repeat in the same order. I don’t think you mention this, but sorry if you have. The patterns are 12  4,  12  4 (I call the &quot;2 1s&quot;, the root is on first 2),  followed by 1  34, 1 34, (the &quot;1 2s&quot;, the root is on the first 4 ) finally 1  3  5,  1  3  5 , 1  3   5  (&quot;The big 3&quot;, the root is on the 2nd 1) then you are then back to the 2 1s again. Going up and down the fret effectively scrolls this pattern, so it just a case of quickly realising which line you are on in it. Another thing I&#039;ve found is if you are on  a 12 4  and quick slide up the fret when about to hit 1 you can switch up to 1  34. and of course do the reverse and similar with &quot;the big 3&quot;.  Finally, switching in the root notes in on your three start positions means a key change is easy and immediate. Sorry if this makes no sense, you would have explained it much better and I will understand if you don&#039;t post this bit, but it has certainly worked for me. When fully locked in I will  work my way through the other scales to see if they each have a useful repeat pattern. Keep up the brilliant work Scott and I must get around to subscribing. And oh yes, I like your wedding photos with a difference on RBs web site.]]></description>
