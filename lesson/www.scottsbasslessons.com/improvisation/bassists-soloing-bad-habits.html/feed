		<description><![CDATA[Dude, extremely inspirational!
Focal Dystonia?
I&#039;ll tell you what, I can&#039;t tell
Your playing has given me the fortitude and inspiration to work back into playing electric bass after 3 &#039;silent&#039; strokes.
I too could barely do a major scale on my bass after suffering a seizure in Jan 2015 (and by my saying &#039;barely&#039; I mean not a (correct) note to be found)
I&#039;m subscribing and sharing.
Sincere regards,
Joe]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, Nice lesson. As far as I&#039;m concerned, there&#039;s a very important exercice to link between the two steps you&#039;re showing : one chord tone and solong : it&#039;s just to work a walking bass starting on each chord tone : just to take rythm and everything else out, only quater notes, and make sure I can go through the changes lending on each third, each fith, seventh ... Cause going straight from playing one chord tone to imrpo seems like a huge gap, I&#039;m afraid some might just get lost.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I see o one addressed yu DBL question, but, really....it&#039;s pretty hard to do wrong with a Mexican P-Bass.....almost all of Fenders are now made n Mexico (or Indonesia, but the Fullerton guys trained the Mexicans and set up the plant near Ensenada.

A MM P-bass can be grabbed anywhere on eBay....just add a high mass bridge and maybe a decent set of tuning keys (but in most cases, that it isn&#039;t even necessary...just tighten her all up with a screwdriver and start getting that P-bass growl (much better than a J-Bass in my view!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you&#039;re referring to EQing &quot;post&quot; normal three to five band EQ by using a parametric EQ, it is a whole different approach!

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you kindly Scott,

Soloing and building solos are things I am well aware of and have gotten good at as of late with alot of tips and tricks and great lessons teachers at my former University, but starting from the fifth is just... amazing. Never have anyone told me that nor have I thought of it myself. It&#039;s just so easy and it takes you &quot;above the harmonies&quot;, it sounds great. What is even more fun is starting from the fifth, theh nthe third, then the second, then the seventh then the fourth and then let the imagination take you to that special place of grooviness!

It&#039;s just fun as h*ll playing along with that backtrack all day, I know what I&#039;ll be playing this weekend!

Thanks alot for the great inspiration!
Kind regards
Daniel]]></description>
