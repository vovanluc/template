		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott,

Great &quot;stuff&quot;, as always. I really look forward to the day when I&#039;ll have more time to devote to my bass practice. The bright thing is that the great material you put on your website helps me in no small way 1. to look for ways to find a little bit of time and 2. to work my tail off on the things that fill the fridge in a more efficient manner (so that I won&#039;t have to work my a.. off on them forever...).

One question, Professor: &quot;I sat down for a month with my bass and a stack of records and began to transcribe&quot; --&#062; I think we won&#039;t argue on the benefits of transcribing and that it should be an important part of our practice schedule. Could you tell us about the tools you use and/or recommend (if any) to make transcription a bit easier and accurate? i.e. hardware, software, tips &#038; tricks, etc. Perhaps you have a post or a vid on the subject in the pipes?
I too work on a Mac but I guess the majority of your visitors work on Win...

Thanks again! (and in advance for your reply, if you can find 5 mns in your busybusy summer schedule)

Francis

PS: a nice piece of FREE notation software can be found here: http://musescore.org/en . Works on Mac,  Windoze and a bunch of Linux distros ;-).]]></description>
