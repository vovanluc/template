				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a LOT of scales, right? - I think we all know that. </p>
<p>And, I think we can also admit that it can be totally overwhelming knowing which one to learn next, which one will be most useful to us for where we're at right now as a bass player... and in some cases, just how to use scales in a practical and musical way... </p>
<p>Well, check this out...</p>
<p>In this new video, I'm going to show you the only 5 scales you'll ever need to learn!   </p>
<p>Sound crazy? Well, there's method behind the madness ;) </p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Usually in my lessons I tell what you 'should' be doing to get your bass playing to the next level...</p>
<p>So, I thought it'd be fun for this lesson to switch that around and to tell you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what NOT to do</span>.</p>
<p><strong>In this lesson I discuss:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Why knowing your <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/play-multiple-octave-scales-like-bad-ass.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scales and arpeggios</a> will NOT make you a better soloist</li>
<li>The simple things you could be doing to make you <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/outlining-the-changes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a better soloist</a> - but you're probably not</li>
<li>What you <em>really</em> NEED to know about <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/developing-your-vocabulary-with-the-blues-scale.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the blues scale</a> (we've ALL been guilty of this)</li>
<li>And, much more</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm going to share the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">top 10 bass soloing MISTAKES</span> that SO many bass players are making... in fact, it's very likley that you're already making some of these mistakes - I know I've made them all!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<p>In this lesson Iâm going to show you that with just 5 simple shapes you can utilise the entire fingerboardâ¦ and the best bitâ¦ <em>none</em> of these shapes are more than a 4 fret stretchâ¦</p>
<p>VERY cool! ;)</p>
<p>But wait, thereâs moreâ¦</p>
<p>-- Iâve also got a super special guest with me (Evan Marien)â¦ who happens to be a ridiculously epic bassist.<br />
-- I get down and dirty with his Ken Smith bass (and yesâ¦ I want one!).<br />
-- I show you how to get completely new textures from a regular pentatonic scale.<br />
-- And as alwaysâ¦ other fun bass shenanigans! ;)</p>
<p>As always, Iâd LOVE to hear from you guysâ¦ have you learned or even heard of these 5 shapes before?â¦ or have you been stuck using the same old shape for waaaaay too long? Lemme know in the comments below the videoâ¦</p>
<p>See you in the shed,</p>

<p>Are you confused with what the modes areâ¦ or, how you can actually use them in a real musical setting?!</p>
<p>I was for a LONG time until I found the exercise Iâm going to show you in the this lesson.</p>
<p>Iâve also got a VERY special guest with me in the new lessonâ¦ one of my favourite all time bass players. Ever. Iâd go as far to say heâs one of the most musical and lyrical soloists on the bass Iâve ever heard.</p>
<p>Anyway, letâs do thisâ¦</p>
<p>As always, Iâd love to hear about youâre experiences too - my feeling is that although many players know what the modes are - most struggle with applying them in a practical way to their bass lines, grooves, fills and solo lines. Butâ¦ lemme know what youâre experiences are under the video in the comments!</p>
<p>See you in the shed,</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. Weâve got a new feature here at ScottsBassLessonsâ¦ Introducing the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/notes/student-spotlight-maddie-jay.html" target="_blank">SBL Student Spotlight series</a>.</p>
<p>We decided itâd be cool to share some of our studentâs stories to highlight the awesome things some of our students are doing. This week we published our first one with the always grooving <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/notes/student-spotlight-maddie-jay.html" target="_blank">Maddie Jay</a>.</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>Okâ¦ letâs talk GOSPEL CHOPS!</p>
<p>Weâve all heard epic gospel players such as Sharay Reed, Justin Raines and Fred Hammond tearing it up with those crazy sounding gospel bass fillsâ¦</p>
<p>And letâs get it straightâ¦ we ALL want to get those into our playing, right?! ;)</p>
<p><b>Well, in this lesson Iâm going to show you:Â </b></p>
<ul>
<li>How to work those gospel style bass fills into your playing</li>
<li>2 scales you can use to achieve that gospel sound</li>
<li>And an AWESOME exercise that will enable you to get your hammer-ons and pull-offs together (this is a big deal for getting the correct feel within your gospel style bass fills)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Okâ¦ question for you guysâ¦</b></p>
<p>Who are your favourite gospel bass playersâ¦ and what albums with them playing on should I check out? As you can imagineâ¦ Iâm a TOTAL bass nerd and love finding out about what and who you guys are listening tooâ¦ make sure you let me know by leaving a comment below the video!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shedâ¦</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. If youâre going to be coming along to the London Bass Show this weekend (March 4th and 5th) Iâm going to be there with the SBL teamâ¦ plus weâre going to have our own room and will be running 4 workshops per day with SBL faculty members such as Cody Wright, Zoltan Dekany, Steve Lawson, Phil Mann, Chris May, Stefan Redtenbacher, Geoff Chalmersâ¦ and me!</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>The melodic minor scale... it was something I simply couldn't get to grips with for SO long!</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I could play it up and down the neck and back to front - but I just couldn't "hear it"... when I tried to use it within my lines it just ended up sounding too forced, or simply just wrong.</p>
<p>So, I ditched for a while... then went back to it... then I ditched it... then I went back to it... then ditched it... I'm sure you get the idea!</p>
<p>Years after I originally learned the scale, I stumbled upon an article someone had written focusing on how to use the melodic minor over <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/quick-riff/diminished-arpeggios-over-dominant-chords-quick-riff.html" target="_blank">dominant chords</a> by playing it up half a step from the root - in other words playing the super locrian mode.</p>
<p>I *think* the original article was written by a sax player... but I could be wrong... I sometimes forget what I've done 2 minutes ago!</p>
<p>That article opened a HUGE can of worms for me... and not only did it help me find "that sound" I was looking for with the melodic minor - it also led me to discover a whole new set of substitutions you can use of dominant chords.</p>
<p>It's those substitutions I want to show you in this lesson.</p>
<p>I've had a heap of fun with them for such a long time - I'm hoping you do too!</p>
<p>If you like the lesson... check out some of my others, you might like 'em... and if you do, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com" target="_blank">check out the Academy</a> at... it's a KILLING online school for bass players.</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to show you one of (if not 'the') most important chord sequences I have ever learned.</p>
<p>If you haven't noticed yet - most songs are built from the same types of chord movements... and learning these will be HUGE for your bass playing and overall musicianship.</p>
<p><strong>In this lesson you're going to learn:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One of the most important chord sequences you'll ever learn</li>
<li>Why you should be focusing regularly on common chord movements - and what they are</li>
<li>Why we use numbers toÂ explain chord sequences (and how it works)</li>
<li>Why recognition of common chord sequences will be AMAZING for your ear training</li>
<li>Why and how to implement arpeggios and scales over these sequences</li>
<li>How to develop your soloing vocabulary over these sequences</li>
<li>Bass line creation over common sequences</li>
<li>And loads more...</li>

<p>To really push your playing to the next level, being able to <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/how-to-unlock-your-bass-fingerboard-epic-scale-exercise.html" target="_blank">visualise the available chord tones</a>Â (arpeggios) and scales around the neck at the drop of a hat is what you should be aiming for. It's going to take some work and dedication, but if you keep consistently practicingÂ exercises such as the one you're going to learn inÂ this lesson - you'll get there.</p>
<p>In this lesson you'll beÂ learning an exercise that will show you an easy way to start gaining more freedom and better visualisation around the fretboard by simply mixing your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/unlock-fretboard-must-see-lesson-bass-players.html" target="_blank">arpeggio patterns</a> - i.e. by not playing the same ascending and descendingÂ patterns within the same pass.</p>
<p>The concept is actually super simple... but like with most things, it's sometimes the simplest things that can make the biggest differences.</p>
<p>Hey, and if your a more advanced player... don't worry... this exercise will certainly keep you on your toes too ;)</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

<p>Before you get rolling with this exercise - <em>take it slowly</em>.</p>
<p>It's not about how fast you can play it, it's about making sure you're playing the <em>correct notes</em>.</p>
<p>Another fantastic thing to add to this exercise is to say the note names out loud as you play them. It's tough - but take it slow and you'll get it!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

<p>
<h1>LESSON SUMMARY</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/speed-bursts-bass-arpeggios-lesson.html" target="_blank">Arpeggios</a>, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/play-multiple-octave-scales-like-bad-ass.html" target="_blank">scales</a>, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/chord-tones-bass-exercise.html" target="_blank">chord tones</a>, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/gary-willis-style-pentatonic-lick.html" target="_blank">pentatonics</a>... I could go on...</p>
<p>We all get told to learn them - <em>but what for?!</em></p>
<p>If you think about it, they're simply collections of different notes organised by intervals. There's nothing more to them than that. But, if you've been playing a while I'm sure you'll agree - even if you know them all, by no means does it mean you're going to be able actually to use them.</p>
<p>And, therein lies the problem!</p>
<p>Simply learning to play scales up and down the neck, back to front, standing on your head (if you really want to!), unfortunately doesn't mean you're going to be able to make music real from them.</p>
<p>I'm sure you know what I mean...</p>
<p>You learn a scale, play it up and down a one octave pattern across the fretboard, it feels pretty comfortable... but now what?! You're stuck, and don't know where to go with it after that. When you play it - it simply sounds like a scale.</p>
<p>Here's another spin on it...</p>
<p>If we take the letters A B C D E F G... these mean nothing, they're just letters.</p>
<p>But, looking closely you can make words from those 7 letters...</p>
<p>BADGE. CAGED. FACED.</p>
<p>We can directly apply this exampleÂ to scales.</p>
<p>A scale is simply a collection of notes, you have to learn how to string the notes of the scale together to make melodies, bass lines, solo lines and chords.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Learning a scale is similar to learning the alphabet. You need to take the next step and learn how to make words with them - then you'll be able to really speak with your bass lines, grooves and solos.Â </strong></em></p>
<p>So, how do you do this?!</p>
<p>Well, this is where studying <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/jazz-style-bass-lick-lesson.html" target="_blank">vocabulary</a> comes into play.</p>
<p>You should be learning other people <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/using-pedal-points-bass-lesson.html" target="_blank">bass lines</a>, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/running-out-of-soloing-ideas-try-out-these-awesome-substitutions.html" target="_blank">solos</a> and <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/bass-grooves-articulation.html" target="_blank">grooves</a> - then, (<em>and this is the important bit!</em>) learning which arpeggio or scale they are related to. This gives you instant insight into how other bass players are using <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/mastering-your-bass-fingerboard.html" target="_blank">arpeggios</a> and scales to make real music.</p>
<p>You've heard that transcription is important? Well, this is why.</p>
<p>We should be constantly studying how other players are using vocabulary within there playing - and actively absorbing that vocabulary into own own.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this is what will give you your own sound in the future.</p>
<h1>YOUR HOMEWORK</h1>
<p>In the comments below, let me know...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1.</strong> Have you felt confused and frustrated when learning scales before?<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Has this lesson helped clear up any confusion for you?<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Who are you transcribing right now - and, which bassists are on your list of players you're going to study?</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If youâre anything like me, every now and again you just want to learn a good olâ dirty sounding <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/riff-of-the-week/funk-soul-groove-bass-playing.html" target="_blank">groove</a> that makes you wanna sayâ¦ <em>âOoofâ</em>â¦</p>
<p>Well if today is one of those dayâs for you, youâre in the right place!</p>
<p>As well as teaching you a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/danny-mo-morris-r-b-bass-lesson.html" target="_blank">great bass line</a> that will make anyone in their right mind <em>get their groove on</em>, Iâm also going to demonstrate a couple of great harmonic devices that you can use over static dominant chords immediately.</p>
<p>I wanna give you the <em>âOoof factorâ!</em></p>
<p>This groove is based around an E dominant 7th style vamp, and both of the licks include the minor 3rd. Now if you know anything about dominant <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/chords/playing-chords-on-bass-getting-your-voice-leading-together.html" target="_blank">chords</a> youâll know that they are an extension of the major triad, i.e. the minor 3rd is essentially a wrong note - but, in this style of groove it still works! In fact it does more than work, it sounds fantastic and gives the bass line that real bluesy style sound.</p>
<p>I incorporate these types of lines and runs within my grooves as theyâre a great way of expanding of the dominant 7th sound, and in-turn give you more options when grooving and soloing over static dominant chords.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shedâ¦</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So What (originally composed by the great Miles Davis) is one of those tunes that getâs called <em>time and time again</em> at jam sessions.</p>
<p>In fact, if youâre starting to think about attending a local jam session, or if youâre already attending them - you <em>need</em> to know this tune. Simple as that.</p>
<p>The gag is, that due to itâs modal nature people tend to get lost within the form very easily and ultimately it can end in a total train wreck.</p>
<p>Honestly, I couldnât count on <em>10 hands</em> the amount of times Iâve heard this tune end in disaster during jam sessions.</p>
<p>So - let's make sure that it doesn't happen when you're taking care of business! ;)</p>
<p><strong>Letâs look at the chord sequence:Â </strong></p>
<p>Dm7 Â  | Dm7 Â  | Dm7 Â  | Dm7 Â  |</p>
<p>Dm7 Â  | Dm7 Â  | Dm7 Â  | Dm7 Â  |</p>
<p>Ebm7 | Ebm7 | Ebm7 | Ebm7 |</p>
<p>Dm7 Â  | Dm7 Â  | Dm7 Â  | Dm7 Â  ||</p>
<p>As you can see, thereâs a <em>lot</em> of Dm7 â and that is exactly where the problem is. When playing through this tune, if you donât know how to map out the form youâre in danger of getting lost in a sea of Dm7 very easily.</p>
<p>But donât worry, help is at hand!</p>
<p>In this lesson <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/todd-johnson" target="_blank">Todd Johnson</a> is going to show you a fantastic way of mapping out the form of So What by simply inserting II V <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/running-out-of-soloing-ideas-try-out-these-awesome-substitutions.html" target="_blank">substitutions</a> over the minor chords. By using this technique youâre not only going to give your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/using-pedal-points-bass-lesson.html" target="_blank">bass line</a> much more shape and contour, youâre also going to hold the rest of the band together in a way that everyone will know exactly where they are within the form. The cool thing is, they wonât even know why they're not getting lost anymore... all theyâll know, is that when they play with you - everything just works!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shedâ¦</p>
<p>Scott.</p>
