		<description><![CDATA[I recently learned this inversely from my local bass teacher when I asked about soloing. If your static chord (or song structure) is minor (say Cminor blues) your bass solo can take off from a Major scale that begins from the minor 3rd of the static chord ( or D# in the C minor case). Both Relative minor scenarios that I had learned in theory class years ago and forgotten. To cool to hear though when you begin to play riffs!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s see if I have gotten this straight:

[a] When you superimpose the G melodic minor scale on top of a C7 chord, gives a &quot;C Lydian dominant&quot; sound. I take this to mean a C Lydian scale, but with a flat (dominant) seven, instead of the usual major 7. Is there a (greek) name for this mode, and which scale is it derived from? The G melodic minor scale contains a minor third, but a major seventh, so it corresponds to a &quot;minor major seven&quot; arpeggio.

[b] When you superimpose the Db melodic minor scale on top of a C7 chord, it is the equivalent of playing a &quot;C altered scale&quot;. That would mean the altered scale contains the b9, b5, b13, b7 - or, if you like, both a minor and a major third. My understanding is that an altered scale can be pretty much anything, but usually contains the b9 and b5, at least. Does it always contain both the major and minor thirds, or are there both major and minor altered scales?) Scott also says that this corresponds to the C Superlocrian mode. How is that mode constructed? And another thing: If an altered scale contains, say, a b9 or a b13 - does it go without saying that it cannot also contain the usual 2 or 6?

C Major scale:    C       D       E       F       G       A       B

                           1        2       3       4        5       6        7

C Mixolydian:     C       D       E       F       G       A       Bb

                           1        2       3       4        5       6       b7

G mel. minor:     C       D       E       F#      G       A       Bb

                           1        2       3       #4      5        6       b7

Db mel. minor:   C       Db     Eb     E       Gb     Ab     Bb

                           1       b9      b3     3       b5     b13    b7

I note that two melodic minor scales together contain ten out of twelve notes - every note except the natural F and B (!) Together with the Mixolydian scale, which contains the F, every note is used except the major seven, B. So if you combine the scales you can make chromatic runs all over the fretboard if you just stay clear of that B. (But see my question above: If you want to bring out the characteristic sound of a C altered scale, I guess you should avoid the natural notes between the altered ones.)]]></description>
