		<description><![CDATA[Always interesting and I love how musical your playing is.
That may sound redundant, but it is great to hear the
bass speak in a melodic voice rather than as a percussion
element.  Not that percussive playing is wrong, but this
gives one such an expanded vocabulary. Thank you.]]></description>

I was wondering, how do you get that amazing warm and clear sound?
What sort of gear do you use?

Thanks again for great lessons, use them a lot!]]></description>
