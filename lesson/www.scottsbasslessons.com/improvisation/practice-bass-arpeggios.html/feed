		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,
I just had a brilliant idea... LOL No seriously, sometimes it is hard to see how you place your left hand fingers. Here&#039;s my idea... : If you put for coloured marks, one colour for each on the top of your fingers (where your nails would be for example), it would be very easy to see which finger is where.
And I just love your lessons, very much to the point, you know where you want us to go, and just doing the lessons really brings quick results. So thank you, Scott!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[These are the lessons I&#039;ve been needing! I&#039;ve only watched Pt 1 but after that I was able to spend 15 mins grooving on Dm over almost the entire neck! YES! After 14 years of playing (learning songs by sheer might of will and then playing them with bands) I can improvise over just about the whole neck! 

I&#039;ve got a TON more to learn. I have to figure out how to do this over a progression but that 10 minute video has unlocked what 14 years of playing hasn&#039;t been able to. 

SWEET!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As one old dog to another, I assure you that my goal is not to make anything more challenging just for the sake of making it more challenging. But personally, I find it much more fun and interesting to try to use the basic principles to figure things out on my own than to try to learn Scott&#039;s particular fingering of this one particular chord progression in this one particular key. I feel sure that I am absorbing the ideas more effectively, and making faster progress toward incorporating these ideas and techniques into my own playing, this way -- all of which makes it more rewarding as well.


In fact, I&#039;ll admit that I&#039;ve actually spent very little time practicing the arpeggios for the Dm7-G7-Cmaj7 progression that Scott uses in the lesson. I don&#039;t play jazz (and don&#039;t aspire to), and in the kinds of music I play the ii-V-I progression is not nearly as common as it is in the jazz &quot;standards.&quot; So, instead of practicing that, I like to create my own exercises and figure out how to apply the same principles to chord progressions and keys that are more familiar and directly useful to me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,

New to the community.  Love the content so far, but you&#039;re killing my rhythm by showing all of the arpeggios on a 5 string with a high C.  I have a 5 string, but with a low B.  I&#039;d imagine the number of people with a 5 strings with high C is pretty darn small.  Makes it really difficult to flow along with you when I run out of strings!  If you could focus more on a basic 4 string setup (even for those of us with a low B), it would make it much easier to follow along with the lesson.

Thanks!
Mark]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott
In the G7 arpegio, you play an F, i thought the seventh was F sharp.
So what is this F ?
Great great job you do.
Love it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott - do you have any tutorials on this double bass technique that Martin speaks of?  I have girly hands too, which is very appropriate as I&#039;m a 5&#039;2&quot; woman (who loooooves to play bass).  I need all the tips and tricks I can get to compensate for my small hands.  Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Question:  Let&#039;s say it&#039;s a more basic chord progression, without the 7ths.  Would this arpeggios still work even if the lead isn&#039;t playing the 7th notes?]]></description>
