		<description><![CDATA[When i started out I used to try and make logical kind of melodic sequences around the chord tones on tunes like this, and I even might have hit the dominant to the chord  sometimes, just to keep track. Well, I thought i was cheating somewhat :-) but nothing seemed to be further from the truth when I transcribed. Gary Willis starts out with I  VI  II V on the tune. Minor Elegance, with Joe Diorio, Robben Ford  and Peter Erskine. (1989) A feast for the fretless lovers, there&#039;s some amazing bass solos on the CD as well. It&#039;s a pretty much straight ahead session, really cool all 4 of them. Scott: If you ain&#039;t got this CD, you should be punished!  :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m really not trying to dis the lesson.. which is a great one... the guy who I&#039;m studying with has told me - put a mark at the top.  A mental stake in the ground every time you get to it.  Building 2 bar or 4 bar phrases, repeating a figure, and a bit of a pedal tone at the turn (and before the B section).   Here&#039;s another way to mark the form:  Tell your drummer: &quot;Pay attention - keep the fills at the turn&quot;.  Get in cahoots with the piano player with eye contact, and get explicit with the rhythm section.  Drum, bass, and piano (or guitar) are the three legs of the stool, and if you three are solid, there isn&#039;t  a horn player in the world who can kick it out from under you.... ;)

		<description><![CDATA[I agree completely. I try to avoid any type of tonal progression when playing in modal fields. There are other ways of outlining the forming and cuing fellow musicians - some that don&#039;t even require notes (use rhythms, dynamics, phrasing, etc.). Using just the root of the dominant can help, but never an entire outlining of a dominant 7th with alterations. That&#039;s how a lot of 20th century composers established a center. Since they no longer wanted the dominant 7th chord to be the chief of harmonic movement, they used the &quot;Sol&quot; to &quot;Do&quot; movement since it was such a strong indicator in earlier tonal works, yet didn&#039;t require entire chords or raised leading tones.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t the point of this song to do away with the ii-V sound?  I understand about marking the form, but the V chord in this tune is like a sus, not your  bebop altered dominant kind of sound....I think that tonality is what Miles was trying to avoid... and what makes the bridge sound like a huge change.......]]></description>
