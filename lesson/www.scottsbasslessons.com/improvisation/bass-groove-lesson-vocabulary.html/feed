		<description><![CDATA[Scott, just wondering. So if the band is vamping say on a B7 chord. B7 is out of the Emaj scale. When throwing that lick in there do you follow the Emaj tonality or would you switch between that and a Dmaj scale? I&#039;m fooling around with throwing that minor third in there and it sounds great but when I start to riff around a bit it doesn&#039;t sound right. At least when I&#039;m trying other things. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[and here is some sayings that fit ourconversation:  You cannot reconcile creativeness with technical 
achievement. You may be perfect in playing the piano, and not be 
creative; you may play the piano most brilliantly, and not be a 
musician. You may be able to handle color, to put paint on canvas most 
cleverly, and not be a creative painter. You may create a face, an image
 out of a stone, because you have learned the technique, and not be a 
master creator. Creation comes first, not technique, and that is why we are
 miserable all our lives. We have technique -how to put up a house, how 
to build a bridge, how to assemble a motor, how to educate our children 
through a system we have learned all these techniques, but our hearts 
and minds are empty. We are first class machines; we know how to operate
 most beautifully, but we do not love a living thing. You may be a good 
engineer, you may be a pianist, you may write in a good style in English
 or Marathi or whatever your language is, but creativeness is not found 
through technique. If you have something to say, you create your own 
style; but when you have nothing to say, even if you have a beautiful 
style, what you write is only the traditional routine, a repetition in 
new words of the same old thing.So, having lost the song, we pursue the 
singer. We learn from the singer the technique of song, but there is no 
song; and I say the song is essential, the joy of singing is essential. 
When the joy is there, the technique can be built up from nothing; you 
will invent your own technique, you won&#039;t have to study elocution or 
style. When you have, you see, and the very seeing of beauty is an art.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A couple of things to clear up. 

.
First, I&#039;m not Scott, my name is Stefen, and I am a music student (even though I have been playing music for over 40 years, there is always something new to learn.)
.
Second, I&#039;d like to clarify what you mean by &quot;spontaneous improvisation is out of thought&quot;, specifically, what you mean by &quot;thought&quot;. I think, but I could be wrong, that what thought is to you, I call &quot;meta-thought&quot;. Let&#039;s see . . . 
.
When I write or speak these words, I don&#039;t think about it, they just come out. Similarly, when I hear music (and even when I don&#039;t), I don&#039;t think about things to improvise, I just hear them, they flow out like the words I speak. And I can hear in my head, and even sing aloud, these thoughtless improvisations as they happen in real time, and a lot of it, I can&#039;t play on my bass, or even on my sax. To me, then, I suspect what you would call thought is the meta thinking of the ego, which might go something like, &quot;Should I start on the 3rd, or 7th or root? . . . How can I fit in the neato 3rd to 9th run I just learned? . . . Hmmm what should I do now, Oh Oh, that trill thing, yeah! . . . Oh shit, that was a wrong note, repeat it repeat it, . . .  did anyone notice? . . . Remember to do that flat two riff over the dominant 7 chord . . . . Now I can try that run I learned from the fingering exercise . . . .&quot; ----- Is that what you mean by thought?
.
The analog to that for speaking might be hearing in your head at the same time you are speaking, &quot;OK subject, verb, what&#039;s next adverb or adjective?, Which conjunction should I use next? Am I repeating myself?  Is my plurality in agreement? Is my participle dangling?&quot;
.
If that is what you mean by thought, then in that respect, I agree with you; if one is thinking about what to play, it is not spontaneous. I can improvise for hours on end and never know what is going to happen next, just like I can sit down to write a story not knowing how it will end until the end happens. 
.
A great quote I have heard, that has been attributed to various musicians, so I don&#039;t know who actually said it, is, &quot;Learn all there is to know about music and your instrument, then forget it all, and play!&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Quite agree Scott with most of your points! Obviously to practice to be spontaneous is oxymoron. Yes, practice is necessary to improve your tools... but let&#039;s say spontaneous improvisation is out of thought (would you accept that?), what place has this thought &quot;i think i am ok/not ok with my improvisation level&quot; or &quot;oh why i can&#039;t play this idea that came to mind&quot;? I would just move to the next doable idea that would come to my head - no space for disappointment or bad energy, if staying out of thought. What I want to say is that behind such thoughts like the ones in quotes is a demanding, ambitious Ego. My music technique is so poor, but i enjoy it so much even to play 3 simple notes that combined with the simple patterns played by others could lead to joy. And the combinations are infinite, even if playing very simple patterns, so no reason for boredom.. if being empty of thoughts/ambitions etc, you get out of time, there is no stress, no fear, no need to be admired, no anxiety.. there is only joy and ecstasy. It&#039;s among the very rare cases that my Ego is deactivated, is silent, and when this happens, it&#039;s the most beautiful thing in the world.

Obviously there is nothing bad to improve your technique, to practice, to develop you skills. All these are great, but for hopeless, non ambitious improvisation they are just not necessary! If improvisation is ambitious then i doubt it&#039;s actual improvisation.

PS: I&#039;ve heard this &quot;I wish i hadn&#039;t studied and practiced so much&quot; - some times excellent technique hinders authentic expression (but this is again a silly intervention of the &quot;Ego&quot;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Practicing to be spontaneous - now that is an oxymoron I should think (and I&#039;ll probably use that one day, thanks!). 
No one can teach you how to be spontaneous, and no one can teach you how best to express what is inside you, they can only layout the tools and techniques of those who have come before us in order to give you an idea of what is possible. Apropos, one should start to improvise as soon as one can with the tools (tone, technique, timing etc.) one has, but always continue to add to and improve these tools (which is where having a teacher and taking lessons come into play). Consider this: could you have written your reply to me if you had only been speaking English for 3 years? And while one can improvise after 3 years (or less) of playing an instrument, statistically speaking, what a typical 3 year old improviser can express on their instrument will have about the same level of complexity and interest as a typical 3 year old talking, that is, after a few minutes. it all sounds the same; there just isn&#039;t enough vocabulary to sustain interest for any length of time. Now if that level is all you are looking for, great! I am sure your musical experience is very satisfying for you, and that is all that matters, but, have you not ever heard a sound/emotion in your head that you wanted to come out of your instrument, but could not do it for lack of the physical fingering ability or musical muscle memory or harmonic insight? To over come that, &quot;teaching and training&quot; as you called it, (and of course listening, I would add), is the answer. They won&#039;t help you be more spontaneous, they&#039;ll just give you a larger musical vocabulary so that within your personal spontaneity, you can convey, with as much force or subtle nuance as you desire, that which lay inside of you to the world around you, that we too might be moved by it.
ps
I have yet to hear anyone say to me, &quot;I wish I hadn&#039;t studied and practiced so much.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[thanks for answering, i don&#039;t doubt that its quite useful to learn a language, or to learn how to play music, this is quite necessary.. but once you&#039;ve learnt it (you&#039;ve learnt to use words, notes, you&#039;ve learnt to create phrases etc) you can use  knowledge as a tool, to express yourself, i think you don&#039;t need to practice to express yourself spontaneously.. both in music and in conversation. Again thanks for such a detailed answer!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you never learned structure, rules, patterns, phrases via interaction with others, being corrected when making a fundamental error, being exposed to something new to incorporate into your own developing expression, then how could you ever learn to speak well enough to hold an impromptu conversation with someone else, which is essentially verbal improvisation, a spontaneous act, where you don&#039;t think about the use of the language you will use to convey your thoughts, you just use them.
Same for the other language we call music.

Same for the other language we call music.<br />
IMHO, naturally.</p>
