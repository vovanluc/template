		<description><![CDATA[I may be asking a question that has been asked below, but cannot find anything in this forum to answer the question of how the 3 substitute minor chords (Am7, Em7, Gm7) were chosen.   Esp as it seems that in the case of Em7 and Gm7 that  there are accidentals in the triads.   

Any help or thoughts?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott I have a question, it has nothing to do with this lesson but it&#039;s really important for me. I would really like to know what kind of glove do you use on your left hand, my girlfriend is starting to learn how to play bass but she has some allergies that leave her hands with some wounds, it would really mean a lot if you could tell me that.
Thanks, and as always, great lesson! ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice lesson! It just be my crappy speakers, but I can&#039;t really hear the tonality of D minor within the backing track. I can&#039;t hear the color tones very well in the arpeggio substitutions. 9th, b13th, etc.. Also, I like your shirt in this video.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lovely !!...Many Thanks Scott for the New Web Site!!...Works GREAT !!...:o)))

 

Questions for You Scott....Can You tell Your Viewers about the Glove you wear...Why you wear Your Glove ?? (I think probably because it shows Your finger placements very well !!)...What kind of glove is it??....Do You wear a glove when &quot;Playing Out&quot;??..

 

.I use &quot;Flat Wound Strings&quot;, coz I hated &quot;The Squeek&quot; when I &quot;Slide&quot; up to another note on the same string... would a Glove help me (and entice Me !!) to use &quot;Round Wounds&quot; once again, to get rid of &quot;The Squeek!!&quot;???

 

Hope you can help Me, AND other Bass Players by answering these questions, Scott !!...Love Your Lessons...I&#039;ve been playing for over 30 years, and You are teaching Me LOTS of stuff I didn&#039;t know about!!...Many Thanks, My Friend!!!...:o))))))))
