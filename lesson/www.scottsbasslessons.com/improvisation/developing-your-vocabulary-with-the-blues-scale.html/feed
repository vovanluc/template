		<description><![CDATA[1. Yep, all the time. Spent all day today doing all the scales including unusual ones like neopolitan and Hungarian minor, major blues, altered minor blues, arpeggios, chords, sixths, tenths, modes, first, second and fourth fingerings, over two octaves etc..... but hardly ever use any of this stuff and do mainly TAB songs and work through bass technique books etc.  I&#039;m hopeless at solo, playing over chord charts, improvising etc. I&#039;m hoping that one day it will all fit into place but in the meantime I&#039;m just learning it and using it as warm up etc. 
2. Yep, a little thanks
3. I&#039;ve only ever done 1 transcription, an Elvis song and it took all day. So much to learn and practice and so little time so I concentrate on other stuff at the moment but I&#039;d like to transcribe James Jameson and Lee Sklar at some stage.]]></description>
