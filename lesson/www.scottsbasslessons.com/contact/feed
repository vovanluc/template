		<description><![CDATA[Hopefully you don&#039;t get tired of hearing how awesome you are for providing these lessons.  Can you recommend any music theory textbook that provides a comprehensive education about theory while touching on some of the techniques that you&#039;ve garnered over the course of your musical education. Greatly appreciated.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott.

Thanks for the marvelous lessons you are creating.
I would sure have used the special offer to get the lessons bundle - but the mails about that were eaten by my spamfilter - so unfortunately I am too late!
If there is any ways for latecomers to sneak in on the offer, just let me know.
I am back on  the bass after a stupid 15 year break ( bad marriage...) and find your lessons both inspiring and very helpful. The thing is that my chops remember how to do the fast work, but my brain can&#039;t keep up. Especially since my main bass is a fretless, I need to get the things nailed down to a point where it gives me a little liberty to keep an ear on the intonation as well... and I find the practicemethod in your ionian-/ dorian scale lesson great. Especially since my bass hasn&#039;t got lines on the fretboard it is best to get the musclememory of the scales in different positions hammered into the automation.
So - great thanks for your work - and just let me know if the offer still stands in any way.
I am not that loaded for the moment.

All the best.
