		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,
Love the lesson videos. I&#039;m just getting back into playing bass after a 10 year break. Always wanted to get back into it, but thought it would be a long way off until my Fiancé surprised me with a gift voucher for my 40th birthday at New Year! Now I&#039;m back in the groove so to speak, but finding it quite hard to get the speed and dexterity back, and indeed correct all the things I did wrong when I played before. Namely anchoring my right thumb on the pickups! Trying to get to grips with the floating/anchored thumb technique with no name... Your lessons are really helping though.

My goal this year is to take my RockSchool grades and if possible climb all the way to Grade 8 by the end of the year so I can start teaching local kids etc... What&#039;s your view on their grading system?

Cheers

Justin]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[regarding the compression.. do you suggest different levels of compression during gigs? i mean - if i get to practice enough to have a sound in a matter of LEVEL - then yes, i could use little compression. but if i slap or play inconsistently, i need a stronger compression. and off goes the dynamics... 

what is the compromise? or just solution: lots of practice?

great video!]]></description>
