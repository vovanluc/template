		<description><![CDATA[Wow, Thanks a bunch for all your effort in getting these lessons to us out here in Youtube land.
Having dropped off from playing an upright bass, I&#039;m learning the electric bass. More change than I would have thought.

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, thanks so much for your great lessons. I am returning to the bass after a twenty year career in the military and trying to get my chops sorted out. I stumbled upon your website and was pleasantly surprised at the quality and content of your material and your instruction. I especially respect the fact that you have overcome the obstacles of your disease. You have done a wonderful thing with your lessons and I look forward to seeing your future work. God bless, thank you, and best of luck!]]></description>
