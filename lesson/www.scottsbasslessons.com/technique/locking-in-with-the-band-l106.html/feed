		<description><![CDATA[So interesting! My instinct is to take &#039;hints&#039; from the keys while pushing the kick, something in the mid-point of the extremes I guess.

Love your video teaching style, you come across superbly well. As a fellow teacher, I&#039;m well impressed by that as well as the playing!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott,
Really good lesson.
No two ways about it, you pick a topic and nail it.
I really like the way you teach.    Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That was fantastic!


Really good solid playing all round and you can only get that know how by playing live.
I suppose it is like two strikers playing for a Football Club who over time develop that telepathy and know each others game.
I only hope one day i will be good enough to get up there myself!]]></description>
