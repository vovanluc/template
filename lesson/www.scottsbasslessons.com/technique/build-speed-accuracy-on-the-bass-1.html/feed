		<description><![CDATA[Hey scott! Love your lessons you have helped me a lot! I am a girl so I&#039;m not able to go very fast due to having small hands, my pinky is pretty much usless, and I just can&#039;t seem to move my fingers fast enough... Was wondering if you had any tips to help me get faster? Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First off, great lesson. Secondly, even though i need to work on building speed with my two finger technique, do you have any advice towards the three or four finger technique? like when bassists are ripping of bop lines and such, are they doing that with just two fingers or using more?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hey scott. I really dig your bass lessons. Tips are really helpful. How would u reckon getting my single straight 16th notes up to speed?

I am stuck at around 140bpm now. Its not easy going fast w/o a pick. My goal is to hit 170. Any tips would be awesome]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott, just wanted to mention that even as a long time player, this series of speed and accuracy exercises have really been helpful! Seen some serious improvements just allocating a little of my practice routine to doing this at accelerating tempos. Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Michael, yeah after a certain amount of repetition the brain just remembers automatically... so don&#039;t worry, it&#039;ll happen!

I don&#039;t really use alternate plucking with my right hand... well I do while ascending (always!) but when descending I rake. You can find out more about it here... http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html

Hope that helps man. Ez, Scott.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello there Scott!

That was another fine lesson, but I noticed you always start plucking with your index finger...

Just a thought :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, 
great stuff. Thx. 
Question concerning right hand training: 
Per &quot;how 2 build up speed&quot;: Will u ALWAYS play ALTERNATLY with your right hand fingers? Sometimes it happens (at me) that i play 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 and then maybe start with 2. Also you may start with 2 OR with finger 1. Is this correct? 
So, what is the brain doing? Will it remember certain trained riffs always playing in the same way? Another riff in another way/sequence of fingers?
 New riff - new set of fingers? 
There must be a point where one does not think any more. You start somehow ... Dont know if my questions are understandable ... Thx 4 attention, greets - Michael]]></description>
