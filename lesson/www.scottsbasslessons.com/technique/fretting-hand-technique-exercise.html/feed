		<description><![CDATA[Scott,

I too was wondering this.  Flying fingers are easily the weak link in my playing.  Since I&#039;m &#039;retraining&#039; my hand, I want to train properly regarding the &quot;multi-fingers down&quot; vs &quot;1-at-a-time-down&quot;.  I know that upright players put all fingers down (I currently do not), but you didn&#039;t address this specifically.  What&#039;s your take?
Thanks!
Greg]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, I intend to join the 10% club.  I&#039;m not clear, however, about what you intend regarding the fretting. In the video, it appears as if you are not using the fretting technique we&#039;ve all been taught.  For example: if with fretting with the 3rd finger, you&#039;re normally supposed to hold down the first three fingers.  But in the video it looks to me as if you are only using one finger. 

The reason this is an important distinction is that I learned the wrong fretting technique . . . I never held down more than one finger.  I&#039;m in the process of retraining to the correct &quot;multi-fingers down&quot; fretting technique.  If I&#039;ve got to do this exercise with only one finger per fret, that&#039;s telling my brain that the &quot;old way&quot; is okay and I&#039;m concerned it will slow my conversion to the correct fretting technique.  I hope that made sense!  Thanks for your advice.  Tom]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, This is off topic because you don&#039;t seem to have a place for general questions.


I am teaching myself to play and have used different books like &quot;Tune A Day- Bass Guitar&quot; etc
Since completing learning the tunes in the book i have started to pick up the melodies of other tunes like &quot;God Save The Queen&quot;, &quot;Eye Level&quot;, &quot;The Blaydon Races&quot;, &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot;, &quot;Land Of Hope And Glory&quot; etc
These are not the Bass Lines in reality so is it wrong for a Bass Player to be playing these things?
I know it isn&#039;t going to do any harm but is it futile to be playing tunes like this on a Bass Guitar?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great lesson Scott, I&#039;ve been looking for this a long time as my fingers love to fly out of the freetboard. I understand this is a slow process, so I have to take it easy to see results. It&#039;s also cool Ralph&#039;s idea of sang the note being played, that will sure help a lot. Thank you guys!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great lesson, and man am I having a hard time with it! One thing I&#039;ve noticed about your playing Scott, is if the nut is at 12 o&#039;clock and the bridge is at 6 o&#039;clock, your fingers approach the finger board from ~3 o&#039;clock most of the time. Mine come in from something more like 2 o&#039;clock, or even 1:30. Is this something I should be trying to fix too? I wish I could get my fingers to &quot;spider walk&quot; across the finger board like yours (or at least *something* like yours! :-)), but I have a hard time trying to hold a 3 o&#039;clock position, especially down toward the nut. If I try, the tendon that goes to my pinky starts to ache in no time at all. :-(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, great lesson as usual.  Do you consciously keep your, for lack of a better term, trailing fingers down or is it just because of the pace of the lesson?  Is keeping them down something you recommend/practice?  Thanks! --Ian]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks! I&#039;ve found as I&#039;m practicing that its the G string where it really flies out of order. What is helping is climbing the string. So instead of spidering up and down the strings, moving horizontally (with the other exercise, of course). 

Thanks again!]]></description>
