		<description><![CDATA[Hello Scott, I was wondering about the first technique you demonstrated. How does the muting work with say, 5 or 6 string bass guitars? I&#039;m currently using 4 string bass, but I might get a 5 or 6 string bass in the future, so does this technique work with them or am I better off using the floating thumb technique (or the hybrid equivalent) on those guitars, since there are too many strings in order to mute them all?]]></description>

love your videos.
Do you have a video on left hand muting technique as well?

		<description><![CDATA[Hi scott! I&#039;m a bit confused. In this tutorial when you play the G string you  put your thumb in the D string. But in another tutorial (right hand technique) when you play the G string you put your finger in A string. Which method is correct? 

Thanks a lot!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m only a couple of months into my bass journey. I&#039;ve started way too late in life to ever become a maestro, but I&#039;m really enjoying myself. I was, however, getting really frustrated with what I thought was buzzing strings.  I thought the problem was in my fretting technique but I now know it was a muting issue!

I&#039;ve been practicing the &quot;movable not quite anchored with floating&quot; technique, with your dynamics exercises. Although concentrating on muting and dynamics at the same time is &quot;doing my &#039;ead in&quot;, there&#039;s already a dramatic improvement in the quality of my sound and I&#039;m not feeling anywhere near as frustrated. I&#039;m hoping that the way it makes my brain hurt is a) temporary and b) working as an Alzheimer&#039;s prevention exercise too!

Your advice has made such a difference ... thanks:)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott really enjoying you&#039;re lessons, but I&#039;m having trouble with playing clean. The hybrid method seems most natural but I find it hard to play fast coming back up because my thumbs in the way. I have been struggling with this for a while now, any advise? cheers :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve learned much so far playing on my only bass, a 5-string. I&#039;ve got plenty of questions and things as my muting technique is quite different from yours (more like the pivoting technique -- I chuckled when you tried to pivot and your thumb just insisted on following out of habit) but I believe your technique is a lot cleaner than mine (besides the fact that you are way more experienced).

But! Primary question first: I would really like to download this video to my hard drive, and my otherwise very capable downloader is not working here. Can I download it? I understand if you do not want your videos to be downloaded and thereby seperated from the site, cause many people don&#039;t, but then I&#039;d just like to mention to you that most of us here in the &#039;third world&#039; have very limited internet connections (compared to European standards) and we often struggle with the bandwidth-inefficient way of doing things that has become extremely common in societies with easy internet access (I visited England and was shocked to see that my friend casually uses youtube as a musical playlist -- and it actually works)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott! 
Firstly, I&#039;d like to thank you for what you&#039;re doing - your all advices are very helpful in developing bass-plaing skills, and thanks to your cheerful and positive approach to teaching, your lessons are very inspirating and motivating as well:) Thanks a lot!  
Also, I&#039;ve got some question to you about how to mute (or play ghost notes) on bare (hollow?) strings in simple one string 8th groove in faster tempo, so as to notes sound staccato?  Its better to play some kind of pulm muting, alternate index and middle fingers with thumb, or use left hand muting? but in the last case the whole process would be in 16th, and its hard to follow up?! I will be very grateful if you give me some advice. 
Thanks in advance!
Best regards from Krakow, Poland.

PS .Sorry for my English;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, this is a fantastic resource for any bass player.  I&#039;m 53 and just starting from nothing, it became obvious almost straight away that I need to focus on my right hand technique before I can even remotely think about what my left hand is doing.  It&#039;s all very well learning from scratch with scales etc but if you&#039;re trying to learn from nothing it&#039;s impossible to concentrate on both hands simultaneously.  I&#039;m saying this should be the first three lessons for any beginner: 1. &#039;THE&#039; most important bass lesson I ever teach!  2. Strap Height  3. Right Hand Muting (Floating Thumb &#038; More!).  Kev.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Mac good question.The angle is always pretty much the same... it obviously changes a tiny bit but nothing noticeable. I kinda use the finger tip to pluck the string as using the pad gives me a little bit to much resistance against the string and ends up slowing me down. Hope that helps! Scott.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for making all this valuable info available.
Having decided to actually learn proper technique rather than just thumpin&#039; away, I discovered it is rather &quot;painful&quot; to develop good right hand movement. But essential: so a few more basic questions if I may. 
Analyzing your right hand motion, the key to producing consistent tone &#038; volume across all the strings seems to be maintaining the angle of attack the same across all the strings?
...or do you change the angle of attach slightly as you cross the strings?
..and is the plucking motion a pulling back across the strings with the pad of the finger, or more finger tip?
Thanks]]></description>
