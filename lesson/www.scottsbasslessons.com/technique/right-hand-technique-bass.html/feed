		<description><![CDATA[Scott,
I&#039;m in my 50&#039;s and haven&#039;t played since I was in high school;  they needed a bass player for our church worship band so I got the bass back out and started working the rust off.  Saw your lessons on Facebook and joined and love them -- BUT -- they don&#039;t seem to be in any particular order.

I&#039;ve kept backing up to figure out where to start -- and the lessons on Technique seem to be the place.

I don&#039;t have any trouble alternating fingers on the plucking hand.  However, you are SAYING that you use two -- but when you pick, you seem to be using the THUMB on your root note.  Am I correct?  I&#039;ve never done that -- and I&#039;m not sure how to start that.  I tend to anchor with my thumb on the wood of the guitar.

Any suggestions?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh man, this is so basic and so hard!! I&#039;ve been used to le tmy fingers do whatever they wanted, but I need to gain speed so I have to re-learn this basic stuff... How many time do you recomend for this excercise daily? 15-20 minutes???]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, I appreciate the lessons you have put together and I have just started here. This is the first lesson I went to because I knew that I had no real knowledge of right hand bass technique while I have a good command of the fretboard. In practicing this technique at slow speed (40 or 60 BPM) I find that I consistently get tripped up changing from the A string to the D string or more accurately when I need to start the next ascending string using my middle finger. Any suggestions on how to break through on the muscle memory aspect of this exercise ? Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great lesson Scott, I&#039;ve been using a hard pick for centuries. I would really like to get motivated to get in the shed and get fluid with plucking with fingers, for the sound and sounds you can get and also because a pick can get pretty hard to hold on to after several hours of sweaty playing. As I was watching this lesson a popup said signup and then the only choice you had to exit back to the lesson was &quot;I don&#039;t want to join&quot;, I have already joined previously, but don&#039;t want to give you negative statistics about who wants to join and who doesn&#039;t, was wandering if you could change the choice to exit back to the lesson, from &quot;i don&#039;t want to join&quot; to something like &quot;Not now, continue with the lesson&quot;, so not to give you inaccurate likes or dislikes about your efforts...Keep sending the lessons, man....just my 2 cents...Steve]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[FWIW it&#039;s nice to see I&#039;m not the only self-taught player who has developed a partially sane, partially disastrous right-hand technique ;) Actually, it would seem that this is a very common problem for &quot;intermediate level&quot; bass players! I got some of the raking and alternation things right without giving it any thought, but also botched them in many cases without understanding why.

I think I&#039;m beginning to understand why the heck I just can&#039;t manage to get dat sp33d. Why I trip up at even very slow tempos of stuff like MarloweDK&#039;s L349. Thank you so much, Scott! For deconstructing and demonstrating important things in detail. I&#039;ve just watched it and already I&#039;m rethinking and repracticing many of the basic bass patterns.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the lesson.  I am a guitar (not bass) player who has spent 15 yrs developing technique through college and I now work in Nashville as a session/live player.  I just got a bass gig and this website is a God-send.  I know how important the basic are, but had no way of getting great instruction.  I appreciate this so much.  Will be spending a lot of time on your site.  Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been playing as what I thought was a proficient level on the bass for over 20 years.  I am self taught, and wondered why I could not gain speed on the strings.  I always felt as if I was tripping over myself, and now I know why.  Thank you so much for this great lesson.  In trying this technique out, I see how messed up my right hand technique is and I will be working on un-learning my bad habits.  I will incorporate this into my practice time every day until I can get it committed to muscle memory.

ipipipipipipip....pipipipipipi...  Thanks!!!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott. I am having a slight issue in that when using alternate plucking, my right hand plucking fingers seem to want to sync with my left hand fretting fingers. 
To explain. 
Ascending on top string (4 notes) – Left index finger on first note – Start plucking with right index finger (I.M.I.M). This ends with M plucking the last note fretted by my little finger.
 BUT
When I drop a string and descend, because my little finger is the first finger on the string, my right hand wants to kick off with the middle finger (M.I.M.I). On the fourth (last) note my left index finger is on the fret which is then plucked with my right index finger.
The plucking pattern thus becomes  
Ascending     …  I.(F 1) – M.(F2) -  I.(F3) – M.(F4) 
Descending   …  M.(F4) – I.(F3) – M.(F2) – I.(F 1) 
- a mirror image.
This feels totally natural and fluid as both hands seem in harmony with each other but it does break up the continuous I. M. I. M. I. M. I. M. pattern that you advocate.
As a total beginner, I am concerned about getting into bad habits early on so my question is, do I go with what comes naturally or do I persevere trying to learn what doesn&#039;t, (in order to save correcting it at a later stage).
What do you think?
Jomo 
BTW. Great site and many thanks for your efforts]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been working these methods for about 3 weeks now and just discovered this lesson today. I&#039;ve been wondering where your speed comes from. The answer is simple enough, but setting up a new right hand pattern (I M, I M) after so many years is another story. I&#039;ll be &quot;in the shed&quot; on this for days, but once again, you&#039;re making a bass player out of me.
Thank you so much
