		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott! 
Good lesson, just wanted to give to the people watching a heads up that you gradually went from /C-Amin-Dmin-G7/  to /C-!!A!!-Dmin-G7/.  No biggie, just so people are aware of it. Also, I find it interesting that the shape you are using when playing major scale from the pinkie differs from the one I use. I would play 4(C) 1(D) 3(E) 4(F) 1(G) !!4(A)!! !!1(B)!! !!2(C)!!. It include a &quot;secret&quot; or &quot;convenient&quot; position change, but it is less of a stretch than the one you use. Have you ever used/learned/taught this position? If so any thoughts on how it compares to the one you are using? Thanks for the cool lessons!
Cheers, 
Valters]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,


If there is one thing I&#039;ve really taken to heart from your previous lessons (actually, there have been many more), it is the three different fingering patterns for the major scale (starting, respectively, on the 1st, 2nd, and 4th fingers). Since I learned that lesson, I have spent at least part of my practice time every day playing scales up and down the neck using all three fingerings. I haven&#039;t yet reached the point where I can &quot;see&quot; an entire scale at one time across the entire neck, and I realize that will take awhile, but in the meantime it seemed to me like this newest lesson could be exactly what I need: That is, a way to break up the continuous-and-seemingly-endless fingerboard into a smaller, more manageable number of &quot;chunks.&quot;


With this background in mind, it seems to me that in the video you didn&#039;t address what to me is the crucial question regarding HOW MANY different positions or chunks the fingerboard can be broken down into to make it manageable. In the video you focus mainly on two positions for the C major scale and related chords: In the first, the &quot;home&quot; frets are 2-5, which in C corresponds nicely to everyone&#039;s favorite fingering for a major scale -- i.e., starting on the 2nd finger and ending an octave up on the 4th finger. In the second, the &quot;home&quot; frets are 5-8, which corresponds to what is probably the second most popular fingering of the C major scale, starting on the 4th finger (and using the &quot;extra&quot; fret to get to the maj7th and octave). 


OK, so that&#039;s two positions that, between them, cover the first 9 frets, and so dividing all that territory into two positions seems like a very useful simplification that I can get my head around. But then it occurs to me that there&#039;s also another natural position that one might adopt (in C) in between those two: with the &quot;home&quot; frets being 3-6, corresponding to the third different fingering of the C major scale starting on the 1st finger. 


So that&#039;s cool, too, but here&#039;s my problem/question: Based on this way of the thinking, it seems to me that the number of possible &quot;positions&quot; is nearly equal to the number of frets on the fingerboard: That is, every time you move your hand up a fret or two, you have a new &quot;position.&quot; And if there are (nearly) as many positions as there are frets, it is no longer clear to me what is gained by thinking about things this way. If there are (nearly) as many &quot;positions&quot; as frets, aren&#039;t we just back to a continuous-and-seemingly-endless fingerboard?


Sorry to be so long-winded, but I&#039;m hoping that the more I could make clear how I was thinking about the problem, the better position you would be in to answer my question. I really think that this &quot;4+2&quot; thing could be exactly what I need at this point in my development, so if you can get me over this little hump I think I&#039;ll be good to go.
