<p>===</p>
<p>Ok… let’s talk about playing fast… really FAST!</p>
<p>I’ve now got my technique to the point where I’m pretty happy with the speed and fluidity I can achieve on the bass…</p>
<p>The gag is, my technique and speed used to be VERY messy (seriously, it was bad!)… I just couldn’t seem to get those super fast runs and lines down.</p>
<p>After a LOT of experimentation and hours and hours in the shed I found 5 super useful speed hacks that really helped me get my technique to where it is now…</p>
<p>If you’re struggling with your faster lines and runs sounding sloppy and/or can’t seem to get up to those faster tempos… this bass lesson is for YOU.</p>
<p>I’ve also got a very special guest with me in this new video… non other than the monstrous bass player, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/steve-jenkins" target="_blank">Steve Jenkins</a>. If you’ve not checked out Steve yet - do it, you won’t regret it!</p>
<p>HUGE pocket, blazing technique, and a feel to die for… Steve’s got it all.</p>
<p>He’s been in the studio with us recording a brand new course with legendary drummer Kenny Grohowski for the membership here at ScottsBassLessons… bass education is going to the next level! ;)</p>
<p>As always, I’d LOVE to hear back from you guys… has playing fast been an issue for you? And if so, what do you feel are your biggest stumbling blocks? Lemme know in the comments below the video.</p>
<p>See you in the shed,</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<p>Ok… let’s talk … SLAP BASS! ;)</p>
<p>I’ve just released a brand new video where I’m going to show you 4 cool slap hacks that really helped me get my slap bass chops together…</p>
<p>I’m talking about arm rotation, positioning, fretting hand percussive strikes (mastering these are super helpful!)… and a crazy fast triplet pattern I do - it’s a heap of fun!</p>
<p>Ooo… and we’ve also got the phenomenal bassist <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/rufus-philpot" target="_blank">Rufus Philpot</a> with us in the studio recording a brand new course for SBL… in this video you’re going to see what’s going on behind the scenes + Rufus gives us run down of his brand new Moollon jazz bass… it’s orange… my favourite colour!</p>
<p>I love to hear from you guys in the comments… so let me know what’s been your biggest challenge with getting your own slap bass technique together…</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<p>In this lesson I'm going to show you one of my all time favourite technique exercises, deconstruct it piece by piece and also show you how you can apply it within your solo lines.  </p>
<p>The great thing about this exercise is that not only does it really push your string crossing techniques to the limit - but by mastering it you will also learn all of the arpeggios that are within the major scale, all in one fingering position! </p>
<p>This exercise is great for your technique, your string crossing, and your harmony chops too. Three birds with one stone!</p>
<p>Ooo... and make sure you watch it to the end, as I also show you how you can take this exercise and start applying it to your solo lines too - it's super fun. </p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. Don't forget, just a week ago we released the first SBL publication of iBass Magazine featuring none other than Will Lee on the front cover! It's full of cool interviews, reviews, and more - plus - to celebrate this first issue coming from SBL we've put an amazing deal together for our entire community so you can become a subscriber of iBass for less than $24 a year!

<p>===</p>
<p>Over the last few years of playing I've developed a sliding vibrato technique where I slide super fast between two frets...</p>
<p>You'll most likely have heard me use it a LOT before, as it's one of those things that makes me sound... well, like me.</p>
<p>In a nutshell you can use this technique to interject that "synth type vibe" into your bass fills, lines and grooves. But most players have difficulty with it because they're making one really simple mistake.</p>
<p>I get heaps of questions about it when speaking to students within the <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy" target="_blank">Academy</a> and also see many bass players really struggling with it, so I thought it was about time to film a lesson for you focusing on this technique and how to get it into your playing...</p>
<p><strong>In this lesson you're going to learn:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All about "the sting" vibrato technique</li>
<li>How to practice this technique so it get's fully integrated within your own playing</li>
<li>The common mistakes bass players make that stop them using it effectively</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<p>In this lesson I’m going to show you one of the most common bad habits I see beginner and intermediate bass players suffering from...</p>
<p>I call it "the see-saw".</p>
<p>If you do suffer from this common bad habit, playing faster lines and riffs will be pretty much impossible... it'd be like trying to run with a ball and chain attached to your foot!</p>
<p><strong>In this lesson you’re going to learn:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exactly what the "see-saw" is</li>
<li>Why it's impossible to play faster lines and grooves if you do suffer from it</li>
<li>A killer exercise that will help you gain much more fretting hand (and finger) control</li>
<li>And most importantly... how to fix this bad habit! ;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully you'll enjoy this lesson and start using this exercise straight away. If you dig it, share it with your bass buddies so they can get in on the action!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>In this lesson you’re going to be learning all about the “One Finger Per Fret System” - and when you shouldn’t be using it.</p>
<p>Misuse of this technique is one of the most common bad habits I see when working with students… so, I thought it was about time to record a lesson around this topic and point you in the right direction!</p>
<p>In this lesson you’re going to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why the one finger per fret system can be bad</li>
<li>Why your speed and general facility around the bass neck can be held back by this technique</li>
<li>Why there’s so much confusion around this system</li>
<li>How and why you should start mixing in double bass type fingerings into your bass lines</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>Have you ever heard two bass players playing the exact same riff - one guy sounds ok, but the other guy sounds AWESOME?</p>
<p>They're both playing in time. Both are playing the exact same notes... but they sound drastically different.</p>
<p>Well, a lot of this is down to what I like to refer to as "Micro-Dynamics".</p>
<p>I'm not talking about general dynamics within a song - i.e. play softly in the verse, and then louder in the chorus. I'm specifically talking about "micro-dynamics" within your bass lines, grooves and fills.</p>
<p>It's soooo easy to overlook these, or even worse not even know that they exist!</p>
<p>So, I thought it'd be cool to show you 3 great exercises I use with students to help them really master these and get them into their technique and bass playing.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. I also wanna tell you about something EPIC that is happening in a few weeks time.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, we're going to be hosting the biggest online bass event in history - it's totally free, and I want you to be a part of it!</p>
<p>We're calling it <strong>"SBL Live 2016"</strong>.</p>
<p>There's going be online seminars with some of the best bass educators in the world, give-aways, competitions, and more... keep a look out for further details coming soon!</p>

<p>In this lesson you’re going to be learning about turnarounds - what they are, how to use them, some of the different variations, and most importantly why every bassist needs to know exactly how and where to apply them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moving around the fingerboard smoothly and effortlessly as possible is something we should all be aiming for - but, it can be a serious challenge to master that type of fluidity.</p>
<p>This is exactly why I recommend that all of my students not only study <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique" target="_blank">technique</a>, but break down the study of technique into bite size exercises focusing on things such as <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/fingerboard-shifting-exercise-bass-lesson.html" target="_blank">shifting</a>, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/plucking-technique-bass-lesson.html" target="_blank">plucking hand technique</a>, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/fretting-hand-technique-exercise.html" target="_blank">flying fingers</a>, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/the-correct-bass-posture-practising.html" target="_blank">posture</a>, and much more.</p>
<p>One of the key factors to gaining a smooth and fluid type movements around the fingerboard is to have a very efficient <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/speed-shifting-exercises-bass-lesson.html" target="_blank">shifting technique</a> - as in, how we move are hands between positions on the fingerboard, and where our attention is focused while doing so.</p>
<p>In this lesson you're going to learn 3 great shifting exercises that will help you not only understand how to work on your overall shifting technique - but also the importance of visualisation when shifting.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There's something we can all be 100% certain of...</p>
<p>At some point we're all going to want to play a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/cool-bass-lick.html" target="_blank">lick</a>, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/vital-groove-technique-below-the-root.html">groove</a>, or <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/awesome-bass-solo-lesson.html" target="_blank">solo line</a> that will be out of our comfort zone - and clearly beyond where our technical capabilities are right now on the bass.</p>
<p>If you've experienced this before or experiencing this right now, don't worry - every single bass player has this issue. Even guys that have a highly developed bass technique such as Victor Wooten, Alain Caron and Jeff Berlin for example will all have these issues at some point.</p>
<p>It's easy to think that once you get to your technique to certain level you will develop bass super powers that will make you indestructible - even the worlds toughest lick will be a like a walk in the park...</p>
<p>Well, I'm here to tell you that it won't.</p>
<p>Yes, as your technique develops certain things will become a lot easier, but at some point you'll be asked to perform a piece of music that has hiding within it a "<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/bass-lick-vocabulary-workshop.html" target="_blank">lick of doom</a>" ;)</p>
<p>It's happened to me personally countless times, and I can guarantee that every bass player on the planet has encountered such a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/awesome-chromatic-lick.html" target="_blank">lick</a> - whatever level they're at.</p>
<p>To be honest, it's a complicated subject - as what one bass player finds easy, another bass player will find hard - no matter if they're at the same level technical proficiency.</p>
<p><em>Why you ask?!</em></p>
<p>Well, that's just the way it works. We're all physically different, and therefore certain physical movements might be easier for one player than an other.</p>
<p>Also, what a player's focus has been comes into play...</p>
<p>Victor Wooten has crazy <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/slap-bass-lesson-the-sectret-triplet-technique.html" target="_blank">slap chops</a>, we can all be certain about that - whereas Jeff Berlin has an insane <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/fast-legato-lines-on-the-bass.html" target="_blank">legato technique</a>. If these players were asked to play each others lines, they would certainly have some challenges ahead of them - even though they both have highly developed techniques.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm certain they'd be able to "get it"... but it might not be as easy as you'd think.</p>
<p>So, how should we go about learning complicated licks, riff, and bass lines?!</p>
<p>There's obviously the "start slow and build it up" technique, which works great. But, in this lesson I'm also going to show another great technique that I use all the time when trying to master really tricky technical lines that are slightly out of my comfort zone.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So first of all just let me come clean - I did not come up with this concept. It was shown to me by the amazing bass player Gary Willis, who I was lucky enough to study with many years ago.</p>
<p>Gary is very <em>'visual'</em> in the way he maps out the fretboard - and that was great for me, as I'm also a very visual learner. I absolutely do not have a million note names flying through my head while I'm playing... my thought process is this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1.</strong> What's the root note of the moment?<br />
<strong>2.</strong> What's the quality of the chord? i.e. major 7th, minor 7th, dominant 7th etc etc</p>
<p>I then assign the correct <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/unlock-fretboard-must-see-lesson-bass-players.html" target="_blank">arpeggio</a> (or scale if relevant) shape to the root note.</p>
<p>I have multiple <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/major-scale-bass.html" target="_blank">arpeggio/scale</a> fingering patterns memorised, approximately 3 for each <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/chords/playing-chords-on-bass-getting-your-voice-leading-together.html" target="_blank">chord type</a>, which gives me the ability to have the 'correct shape' under my fingerings wherever I am on the fingerboard, regardless of what the chord type is.</p>
<p>If you want to find out about this in greater detail, you should check out my full <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy/online-bass-courses/harmonic-layering-arpeggios-chord-tones-scales" target="_blank">scales and arpeggio course</a> as it's over 10+ hours long and takes you through a comprehensive step by step approach of how to map out the arpeggios and scales in this way.</p>
<p><em><strong>So what's the big secret?...</strong></em></p>
<p>What helps me tie all of this knowledge together is the <em>4+2 positioning concept</em> that I'm going to show you in this lesson.</p>
<p>The 4+2 fingering concept is a fantastic way of mapping out your key centres on the fingerboard, and organising the huge amount of information we have to deal with when playing into more manageable chunks.</p>
<p>If you use and practice this concept <em>the correct way</em> (as I'm about to show you in this lesson), it will also help you greatly in learning where all the notes of the fingerboard are.</p>
<p>So without further a due, let's jump into this lesson!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
