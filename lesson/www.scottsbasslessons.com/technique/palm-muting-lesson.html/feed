		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott,

I got a question, I&#039;m just beginning to learn the palm muting technique - so the problem I got may just solve itself once I progress a bit more, but I&#039;m a bit concerned that it&#039;s more an overall technically problem, so I wanted to ask you what you do - when playing with that particular technique - to avoid the lower strings from roaring in the background when you&#039;re playing on the D and G string - is it a question of placing that fleshy part of the heel of my right hand on them??

Thanks for the great lesson - I&#039;m soooo looking forward to get that Motown sound and playing all that great stuff James Jamerson and Bob Babbit did ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fantastic stuff Scott! I stumbled onto your videos and can&#039;t believe your skills as both a bass player and a teacher...and I come from a family of teachers. I think you were playing an acoustic electric bass at one point. I&#039;m thinking of buying one. Do you recommend some or do you stay away from product endorsements.
And either way thanks again for the knowledge.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott: I&#039;m a subscriber and small donor because your lessons nail all aspects of bass playing (especially us beginniners). I&#039;m an older beginner who has seen many of the great contemporary players of our time and the thumb / index player is the style I like. My hands are small so I&#039;ll do the foam thing. Thanks for this post. I&#039;m definitely in the shed on this one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[thanks for just another great lesson, scott. 

i especially like this technique playing the fretless bass, there are these sweet notes that&#039;ll get louder with a little buzz even when they&#039;re muted. 

so i mute them at the beginning and release the muting palm right away, just as i would release a left hand finger when playing a flageolet. (it&#039;s really a sustain monster instrument, love it a lot).

this way they&#039;ll sound out just as bright and lovely, but with a soft and delicate attack phase.

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Robert, I play with me index and middle fingers as well. I just use the thumb and index technique to get that muted/vintage tone, otherwise I play with a regular technique. Ez man, Scott]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Scott. Great vid as always... Do you usually only play with your thumb and index finger? I have always play with my index and middle finger and only used the thunb for muting the string over what I am playing on.

Do you think it would be easier to get familiar with the thumb/ index finger setup or keep going with index/middle finger?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, I didn&#039;t know that about laptop speakers, it&#039;s much better with headphones :)  I think you could still be a tad louder, but that&#039;s just IMO!
Cheers chap.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the heads up Simon! Hey, sometimes the problem is lap-top speakers... they seem to do weird things to bass. If you are watching through a lap top check it out with some headphones as it may sound a little better. have a great day man, Scott.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been a  bit disturbed by this. Decided to try the mute/thumb/index over the last couple of days. Phrasing has always been a huge problem for me. Out of the blue, I was instantly grooving, lovely dead notes everywhere etc. The difference is astounding (to me), straight off the bat.I had an excellent teacher last year who told me my right hand technique was good, though we never touched on my phrasing problems (a hangup for me). I wonder how to get that phrasing across into my usual fingerstyle..anyway ..thanks again Scott, you&#039;re on the xmas list...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott,  Thank you for taking the time out to publish these lessons, but...  Can you turn the bass up please?  Particularly on this one I can hear the backing track and your instructions just fine, I can see you playing but I can&#039;t hear it!

Cheers,
Simon]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott
I love all the stuff you do. It has help my playing immensely and given me more confident in my playing.

Thanks.]]></description>
