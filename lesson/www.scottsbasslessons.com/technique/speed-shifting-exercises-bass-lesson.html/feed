		<description><![CDATA[Love this. It&#039;s similar to what I learned a few years back (I am just getting back into this, so forgive me if my wording is wonky). I slide with the index from the root to the two, then finish out the three and four (normal fingering) on the same string before going up a string (to repeat it by index-sliding from the 5th to the 6th, so on and so forth). Everything just falls under my fingers that way. There are no big stretches, but the index slide is a must. 

But... I still find it hard to break out of &quot;memorized fingering&quot;, which is why I can&#039;t wait to try this method. I need to be able to adapt to wherever my fingers are. Then again, this skill is one of the many things I &quot;need&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You can do both - i recommend getting to grips with both the index ascending and decending, and then the same with the pinkie, Essentially we&#039;re looking for total freedom on the freeboard - but in a way that&#039;s controlled enough to stop us tripping up over ourselves. :)]]></description>
