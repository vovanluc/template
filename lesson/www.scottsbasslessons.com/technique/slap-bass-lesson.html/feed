		<description><![CDATA[Try hitting the fretboard with your left hand at a strict 90 degree angle. I&#039;ve found that if your hand is rounded in shape you get slightly dampened notes or subtle harmonics .... but if you hit that baby head on at 90 degrees with straight, flat fingers (all at the same time of course) you should find your getting the desired effect. I hope that helps.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[40yrs of playing bass in various bands and I&#039;ve never sat down and learned slap bass, picked up the odd groove here and there. I noticed through the years players getting stuck in slap similar to getting stuck in a style ala Jaco. I&#039;m looking forward to going through this lesson. Does the set up on the bass need to be different for slap compared to finger style? I find it harder to mix both and achieve an even volume, especially without compression.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great lesson. I agree and I spent a lot of time on scales, its different modes, chord changes and all the other fundamentals that go with being a well rounded bass player. Slap bass is a lot of fun but I try not to limit myself there, the other stuff is great too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great Lesson! I hope you continue this exploration of slapping further. 
I&#039;m fairly good with music theory etc., but slapping has always eluded me because it&#039;s more of a conceptual problem, and it&#039;s really hard for me to figure it out simply by listening to a recording, which is not that much of an issue with &quot;normal&quot; plucking styles.
So more lessons building up further from this one would be awesome, great approach!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott - this is an eye-opener! Thank you...I&#039;ve never realized that the left hand is also &quot;slapping&quot; somehow.

One question: it seams that you only use the G-String for your index finger for this basic lesson. I guess for slapping one of the &quot;rules&quot; is to use the thumb for the E and A-String and the index (and middle) finger for the D- and G-String, right? So don&#039;t use the D- and G-String with your thumb?

Regards,
Bert]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Finally a basic slap lesson that doesn&#039;t assume I already know what  I&#039;m doing. I really needed basic rhythmic exercises to repeat over and over  to loosen up my forearm. (Seriously Slap-Challenged here) This lesson provides exactly that AND a path forward. So, where there was once only a dark room, a candle now burns.  Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Are you muting the notes (ghost notes) or should we let them sound the note?  It&#039;s these little things that have been keeping me from progressing.

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Scott, thanks for all of your bass lessons, like it. I have question: I dont understand music so well so I dont get how can I play by slap technique in diferent chords like C, G etc? I thought that first note of every bar should be root note but is is all the time E string in slap? Is slap technique just if band play E chord?]]></description>
