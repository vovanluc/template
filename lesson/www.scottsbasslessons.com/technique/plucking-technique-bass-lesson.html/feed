		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott, I&#039;ve got a question about this &quot;free strokes&quot; technique : in another video you made, you talked about muting the strings you don&#039;t want to play, and you showed different ways to do this (either resting with your thumb on the lower strings and changing your thumb position very often like you do, or muting the first two strings like Jaco Pastorius did, with the fourth and fifth fingers of the plucking hand).  The fact is, I watched that video and chose the Jaco style muting technique, but I&#039;m wondering if it can be done while playing free strokes? Or would I have to change also my muting technique?     Anyway thanks for the video, it&#039;s great !]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,
I&#039;ve been playing bass for a few years now, mostly learning from Rocksmith and Rocksmith 2014.

After watching this video I had a look at how I pluck and it seems that I&#039;m using free strokes almost exclusively, but the plucking finger isn&#039;t hitting my thumb, it&#039;s just plucking into the air near my palm.

My thumb stays anchored against the edge of one of my pickups, which was a habit I formed after some advice in one of the early Bass lesson videos from Rocksmith.

Is it okay to anchor my hand by my thumb in this way? When I try to play without my thumb holding me in place I tend to lose track of where the strings are.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, did you ever try adding in your 3rd finger for extra speed?  I practiced using my 3rd finger for a long time and now I&#039;ve got it there like an extra gear if I need more speed.  Sometimes I&#039;ll play using just my 2nd and 3rd or my 1st and 3rd just to change things up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, this is absolutely amazing - it&#039;s taking me over a year to understand this technique (im playing rest stroke) and now you have explained everything less that a 10 min. Thank you so much, it&#039;s now a lot of new things to practice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, sorry to get off topic, but I love the deep, warm tone you get on the &quot;theme song&quot; for SBL!  Like one of Pavlov&#039;s dogs, I&#039;ve really come to enjoy hearing that clip whenever I check in to your latest informative post.  Did you record it just for the website, or is it possible for me to hear the entire song somewhere (and/or perhaps to buy it)?  I&#039;m digging it enough to hear the whole track , if there is one.  Anything you could share about the equipment, strings, pickups (besides you and your fingers) you used to get that great tone would be gravy. I know that even with the same gear, I will have my own sound (which tends to me more old school), but that is a wonderful &quot;modern&quot; tone, too many of which sound cold to me. Thanks for all your hard work and sharing your secrets!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If this finally solve my speed problem I&#039;ll love you forever! I&#039;ve been practicing scales for years and there is still something mysterious missing and making my hands getting tired or losing full control. What about thumb: a) do you use it to damp the string b) do you always move it up and down in order to keep it close to picking fingers?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks. I&#039;ll try to give it a more focused approach I think. Concentrate on making the movement more fluid and making less noise. Re headphones, yes I have noticed that headphones let me hear more noise than when playing through an amp. Would you say that I should not aim to eliminate all noise I can hear, but be more realistic and it&#039;s OK to still have some?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah - I had this too. I just kept shedding it for months and it kind of fixed itself... I know that&#039;s a pretty terrible answer, but it&#039;s the truth, lol. Keep at it - and it&#039;ll happen. Also, if you&#039;re practicing with headphones on it&#039;ll make it sound worse than it actually is.]]></description>
