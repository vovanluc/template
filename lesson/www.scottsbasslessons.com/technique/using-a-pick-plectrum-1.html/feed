		<description><![CDATA[Scott, is it possible to play sixteenth notes like this with fingers only?  How would you go about getting the consistency you do with a pick?  This track sounds to be like 120 BPM would you recommend a pick over fingers at this tempo?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m pleased by this.  I had not touched a plectrum since I saw Geddy Lee playing fingerstyle at Wembley Arena in 1983.  When the knob fell off my pickup selector switch, I bought another from amazon and they sent me a free plectrum!  So now I have to use what the universe has so kindly bestowed upon me, and your lesson shows me how!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was having trouble with &quot;Pick Style&quot; or playing with a plectrum getting my hands working together to create the muting.
I then seen a video from another teacher Russ Rodgers who was showing a woman via a video lesson on how he mutes while applying &quot;Pick Style&quot;.
I asked him about the use of palm muting for this style but he told me that Palm muting was a style that was an off shoot of using the pick which dampens the notes to create a specific sound, And isn&#039;t true &quot;Pick Style&quot; playing.
I have seen various books which will show you the exact way Scott shows you how to do it in his video how to play this style.


Russ told me that if you want your strings to ring out normally without the dampening ridgy sound then you have to get creative and use your free fingers to create the mute for strings you are not using.
The way Russ was doing it seemed like it would take a lot of practice to achieve it but in the process i have come up with my own way of doing it.


I use the same principle of &quot;Finger Style&quot; playing where you use the &quot;Floating Thumb&quot; technique but i float the top edge of my palm to create the mute.
When playing the E string i just leave my hand dangling in mid air without anchoring and you get a lot of flick in your wrist for the attack.
When moving through the strings gravity wise i then use the top of my palm to mute the A string and so on like floating your thumb.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott, I&#039;ve used a right hand fingernails pick technique for years. My fingernails are generally 1.5 to 2 mm&#039;s long. At this length I can get up on my nails to bring in a pick-like brightness along with the thump of the meat of my finger as it hits the next string. I can also turn my finger slightly to keep the nail away from hitting the string at all - for a skin to string pluck. In between I can also use more or less &#039;nail&#039; depending on the phrase. There are a host of player who use this technique, including Chuck Rainey, Jack Casady, and others. Granted, there is the work of maintaining my pointer and index fingernails on my right hand, but generally it works out so I can get what I need. Occasionally I&#039;ve had to resort to nail strengthening applications such as hard-as-nails, but this only when I play really hard for extended periods of time. Thoughts?    - Thanks, Brett]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey guys! I&#039;ve been dealing recently with the pick. The reason I&#039;m playing now with the pick it&#039;s due to after a couple awesome hours of bass playing with my fingers they ended with bubbly type blisters (I have suffered from these before). They hurted in the beginning but later they felt uncomfortable to play music with. Should I keep on playing until my fingers can resist and prevent future blisters?


It would be nice if I could get some tips on what to do.


By the way, Scott your way of teaching is the most efficient and fun to learn. You have inspired me to learn by little steps and to keep on playing til the end.]]></description>
