		<description><![CDATA[Why, Scott, does everyone give such undue credit to Jaco for &#039;revolutionizing the role of bass&#039;. He wrote great basslines, don&#039;t get me wrong (my tune up song is Portrait of Tracy), but many came before him that pioneered the style who are given little credit. To list as few: 

-Ralphe Armstrong: auditioned for Weather Report before Jaco, &#039;71?, using a fretless P bass, and got the initial job because he played fretless and Jaco then copied him. Went on to play for Mahavishnu Orch. and Jean luc Ponty.

-Percy Jones: started Brand X in late 1973, played mostly a P bass and early fretless Wal basses, used a very distinctive bass style utilizing harmonics, double and triple stop slides, and fretless technique.

-Jeff Berlin: recorded alongside many early progressive rock and fusion bands, recorded with Patrick Moraz and Bill Bruford in the 1975-79 period. He often shows much distaste toward Jaco fans due to their constant comparison of his melodic playing style to Pastorius, developed before Jaco even became popular.

I know it&#039;s not a hipster contest when accrediting bassists, but it&#039;s gone too far with Jaco fans.]]></description>

In the video you mentioned that as well as tab/notation on your website you provide details on the exact fingering you use etc. I found the notation but nothing on correct fingering?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott. This piece has really inspired me thanks. Did you start recording the bass directly? It seems that I can hear it clearer and I think it was a good move to play on the regular ole&#039; 4 banger for simplicity&#039;s sake. Are these observations correct?]]></description>
