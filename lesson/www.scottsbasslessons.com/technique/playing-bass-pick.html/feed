		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Joe I&#039;ll look those up and give them a shot, yeah .. I&#039;m a flat wound guy too .. actually I didn&#039;t play for a looonnng time so my dystonia improved some .. I&#039;m probably about 80% of what I used to be .. I can play slow effectively with my fingers but that&#039;s about it .. nothing faster than maybe 70 bpm]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I heard that Steve Swallow uses a copper pick.  Might be an urban myth, but I tried these http://ice-pix.com/copper-flex-med-light-12-pack/ and like them for jazz and latin.  Honestly I&#039;d very much prefer it if I could play with my fingers, but, it is what it is.  I find that the copper provides good articulation.  I also switched to flat wound strings.  That&#039;s my story!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t think it&#039;s only an aggressive sound, though... the few times I use the pick is along with palm muting (you know, resting the side of your hand on the bridge saddles, dampening the strings&#039; vibration just a tad). I use it when I need that &quot;dead-strings/sixties-style&quot; vibe. The pick guarantees a tight attack, while the palm muting gives the typical sixties&#039; thud.
...just my two cents...! ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Lucas... it&#039;s totally cool just to play with your fingers. If the opportunity arises in the future when you want to cop that pick sound, then that&#039;s the time to start looking into using a pick. Thanks for stopping by man! :)]]></description>
