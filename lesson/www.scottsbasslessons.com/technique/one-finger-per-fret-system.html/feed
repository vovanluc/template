		<description><![CDATA[Love this lesson. Especially the clarification about playing octaves in a disco bass line context. I&#039;ve always struggled with trying to get up there on some of those lines even though I have massive hands with very long fingers (Boogie Oogie Oogie by Taste of Honey comes to mind). But what about faster lines like some of James Jamerson&#039;s lines? The intro  and first few phrases in the verse of Darling Dear are a good example. Lots of chromatic approach to octave parts and back to chromatics. My technique immediately goes out of the window when I attempt to play this because I&#039;m only focused on getting to the notes on time. When you come across those lines that are almost a barrage of notes on the lower part of the neck, are you still trying to do that 1-2-4 finger position, or are you going back to the finger per fret technique? (I&#039;m sure that the fingering that you choose is completely contextual so I guess I&#039;m only asking in context of Darling Dear).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Scott.  I don&#039;t recall who famously said it, but &quot;rules, once learnt, are meant to be broken&quot;.  I practice Stu Hamm &#038; John Pattitucci 1FPF stretching exercises; the discipline helps me sight-read up-tempo walking bass lines, but for many grooves it&#039;s just too uncomfortable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Johnny G! I&#039;ve been struggling to apply the 1FPF system throughout the neck and now feel like i can just apply it where it works and move to this adjusted hand position when I need to - thanks Scott! It&#039;s early days for me - I&#039;m almost a year into playing bass so I think this will be more valuable in future than I realise right now...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott.

For myself, on a 32&quot; scale bass, one finger per fret is fine.

There is an optimal amount of tension that the strings should have, but 34&quot; is longer than it needs to be, even with that in mind. I suspect that Leo Fender measured the scale length of a standup, and that was that.

I had a professor that insisted that I push with the tips of my finger bones, use one finger per fret, and not slide my hand ever. He believed that this would help me _avoid_ tendonitis. That guy was nuts. A full scale bass isn&#039;t a plastic-stringed classical guitar. Hopefully your help will keep other people from trying to do that.

My comments aren&#039;t practical advice, folks aren&#039;t going to run out and buy shorter bass, just because I like it. It&#039;s just food for thought.

Thank you for your help,
Paul]]></description>
