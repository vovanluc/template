		<description><![CDATA[I am a novice at age 55 with 2 children. Last fall, I started taking lessons again after a 30+ year hiatus. I am making time each day to practice. But, I am having trouble keeping a flat hand on the frets, especially the pinky. I will try your tip and slow down while doing some exercises. Thank you for sharing! :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Scott! 

First of all, I want to say Thank You for yours awesome work! It&#039;s really great and useful. I found that it really helps to start play bass from scratch for people who also play another instrument. For example, I play flute from 1998 =) 
I play bass almost three years and learned from yours lessons much cool stuff and it works!!
But I want ask you make a lesson about nuances of bass playing for people with small hands and fingers! I think it can helps play right way and don&#039;t beat forehead against the brickwall, haha. If it&#039;ll be possible, please describe and tell about warm ups, stretching, one finger per fret system on small hands (is it really need?), shifting, strengthening of ring finger (sic!), etc.
 
With greets from Kyiv, Ukraine, Sergey.
Cheers!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, thanks for sharing the secrets of the
brain. I heard something like that from different people, also sportsmen, and
collecting similar thoughts from various great achievers makes it even more
verisimilar. I am a left-handed and when it comes to playing bass my right hand
appeared to be literary useless! I thought that I leave left hand for quick
moving along the finger-board, at the same time plucking with right hand would
be easy. But now I see that right hand stops me from any progress. Are there
any specific procedures (surgery may help!!) for make at least my two fingers
at right hand do the job with strings? Sincerely, Stas, Moscow, from Russia with cheers]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott!
Great teachings, mentoring and uncondescending. Like your vids and wish you and your kind would had been around in the pre internet times. Too late to recall my youth playing in Madrid gigs. Not into this for a living although with teachings like yours and others out in the wires, why wouldn&#039;t one choose to make a living playing?
As for me -like someone else mentioned above several months ago, too many bad habits playing, lack of musical theory (believe me i was able to play by ear and feel) all i want now is to re learn and play better for &quot;my Space&quot;. I never cared for approval or acceptabce of my music, for my it is a self gratifying hobby. Keep those vids and lessons coming]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love that this lesson has been posted, I definitely have a problem with the &quot;pinky salute&quot;.  I&#039;ve been playing for 18 years now without any formal training until this site.  I&#039;ve been able to correct flying fingers for the most part, it&#039;s just that one little finger that still gets away from me,  Also, you older ladies and gents that are just beginning your bass careers, welcome and stick with it!! Just like a foreign language it&#039;s never too late to learn.  Even if it&#039;s only picking up your bass for 20 minutes.  Thank you Scott!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Scott .. after 50 years of playing bass very badly in a whole lot of amateur bands I&#039;m a complete collection of wrong techniques and bad habits .. but I always seem to have a band depending on my bass, so I have a double-edged problem. I have to totally reprogram for improved technique, whilst at the same time using (and to some extent reinforcing) the bad habits of a lifetime ... 

Ah well .. not to worry. I&#039;ve decided to pretend there are two of me .. one out there and one at home ... and the new one (at home) is going to start at the absolute beginner level and struggle slowly up the ranks until he overtakes the old lag. I&#039;m guessing that some of the performance and groove lessons I learned along the way will contribute a little to the skills of the &#039;new guy&#039; as he improves ...

Heck !! at 65 you&#039;d think it was a vain hope but hey ... who says you can&#039;t teach an old dog new tricks ?? ... wish me luck :)

Thanks for the lessons. They are an inspiration.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great lesson Scott! I&#039;m working on changing my right hand technique at the minute, my wrist was bent over the body. It&#039;s slow to change but going slow is the only way, they say it takes the brain 3 weeks to change a habit]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great lesson as always Scott, I&#039;ve been playing for over 25 years and feel like I&#039;ve hit a wall and that my playing and technique is rubbish.

These lessons are really helping me focus and concentrate on the simple things, in the past I&#039;ve been far too impatient and given up on certain types of technique, so as &#039;boring&#039; as some exercises might be they are vital and patience is the key to everything.

Cheers :-)]]></description>
