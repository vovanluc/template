		<description><![CDATA[Can anyone please tell me what that lick is that is played many times (mostly to end the phrase), for example at 7:53 and 7:57, and an extended version at 12:39? I&#039;ve listened so many times and tried to play it but I can&#039;t figure out where the slides/trills are to make it sound so funky!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Again attacks! I&#039;m old too using a phone. I have no insecurity as you say but it&#039;s obvious you really have a low flash point as you have a need to respond to something that had nothing to do with you. I have no doubt that Scott probably won&#039;t answer this question. Quite frankly I really wasn&#039;t expecting an answer. But it has been fun toying with your need to stick your beak where it isn&#039;t wanted. But all good things must end. So let&#039;s see if you can let the thread die a quick end or are you that needy as to have the last word. Me thinks it shall be the later as your mentality isn&#039;t large enough to just butt out. Peace out ðŸ˜Ž]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh bae, I&#039;m so sorry for sounding curt. I&#039;m old. I&#039;m using my phone. I have fat thumbs. I would&#039;ve posted a link to the video in which he talks about it. And I think its in his wikipedia page. We&#039;re all bass players here. We&#039;ve all got our insecurities. I&#039;m sorry for pushing a button. I didn&#039;t mean to insult your intelligence to the point where you felt you had to question mine. Just helping a cobber out because I seriously would be surprised if he answered your question. Because of the aforementioned reasons. Sorry again. The Internet is a curt a brusque place. Sorry I can&#039;t link you to the links. Sorry your time is so important. It must be hard. Though if I may be so bold this is a bass player community. Here to help each other out. You&#039;ve spent more time being offended over a brisk answer than it wouldve taken to. ..Well. ..Google it. ]]></description>

The thing that I find extremely hilarious is instead of being friendly and actually answering the question posed. You just post Google it. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gee get a life dude when someone asks you for input they will. Unsolicited remarks are not something I usually address as it shows the over bearing mentality of a small mind. With grandiose thought of themselves. I asked a question of the owner of the site not a lackey who isn&#039;t worthy of answering a question not directed to him. Me hopes you can understand plain English ðŸ˜Ž]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aw hun. Don&#039;t get sad. Your time is precious. Way more important than scotts. I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll love answering a question he&#039;s even made a video about. But just in case he&#039;s busy:step 1 go to Google. 
Type: why does scott bass need gloves?
Then be amazed at the information at your disposal. Amd be further astounded that scotts glove wearing probably has no benefit to you what so ever. Good luck with your life.

		<description><![CDATA[Great video, as pretty much always. Only question i have is that I&#039;m up to transposing everything i play into all the keys. With a lick like this that utilises the open A (6th) how does one put that in a key that doesn&#039;t have many open strings.. say Db. My first solution was just to play them as dead notes....any others??]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott I always see you with the practice glove on. I enjoy your teaching immensely but wonder if you would explain any benefit you get from the glove as I see it becoming a more used product. What is the man reason for your use of it. If this has been asked and answered I apologize I could not find it in any discussions. Thanks Angelo]]></description>
