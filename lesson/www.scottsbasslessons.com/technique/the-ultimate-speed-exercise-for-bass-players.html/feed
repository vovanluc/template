		<description><![CDATA[Just thought I&#039;d share... I&#039;ve been consistently working with this exercise for about a week now and had a breakthrough today! It really came from going back to basics with my right hand fingering technique. It all just came together when my technique and speed connected!

I didn&#039;t realize that over the years I started keeping my fingers straight all the time and putting too much pressure on my thumb as an anchor. Scott has an older video that goes over right hand technique and combined with the above video, I was able to course correct myself. 

Lastly, I recommend videoing yourself up close to playback and watch what you are doing with both hands. It helped me see sooo many things that led to a breakthrough. Hope my comments help someone. Happy playing all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I got to the 5th and noticed that my right hand is not disciplined. &quot;Index, middle, index, index,middle. I pushed it, even though I know I shouldn&#039;t but on getting to note 7, I have a really weak ring finger on my left hand that struggles to be independent..it&#039;s realy poor. Any exercises that would help me work on this finger only? I have real trouble moving this finger and the little finger independent of each other.

		<description><![CDATA[To add to Scott&#039;s lesson this technique also works great for when you are shifting positions on the neck. Take one or two notes of one position and add one or two notes of the next position. Just go round these four notes and build your speed between the positions.This really helps for quickly moving up the neck.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, it&#039;s a wonderful thing to use the left fret hand fast, but what happens if your right hand plucking fingers aren&#039;t keeping up with the left hand fret fingers? How do you get them in sync? I&#039;m sure you have an exercise for finger sync.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, thank you for this invaluable advice on the development of speed. Ho did you train your hand,arm and shoulder muscles to be so relaxed. Clearly your positioning is brilliant and no hint of flying fingers. The difficulty I mad probable all people encounter when learning a new instrument is the issue of over tension. Any tips on your approach will be greatly appreciated. Cheers Baz]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I usually have problems higher up the neck where the frets are further apart. My &quot;final&quot; improvements came after I bought my 5-string (quite hectic at the beginning as my eye/brain saw the B-string as the E-string ;-). The B string has F, E, etc. thus closer at hand. On a fretless bass this even gets more difficult as the fingers need to be right on the note (fret)!]]></description>
