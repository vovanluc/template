		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott! Very cool lesson, there are just a couple of wrong notes that I hear. I learned the piece by transcribing Jaco Pastorius and never used any sheet music. I checked a lot of available transcriptions later, and most (if not all) are missing a couple of notes. That last 3 notes in the first are bar eb - d - c# ... so it&#039;s another 3-note chromatic approach run. Listen to the original very closely and you&#039;ll hear it... and bar 9 is eb - d - c - a ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, figured out &#039;Portrait of Tracy&#039; by picking the stylus off the record a billion times, way back when. Don&#039;t you wish we had digital files back then? Amazing Slo Downer, etc.? Thanks so much for posting this. A great exercise for sure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, there are many way to play that. I learned it on Songstarr.com. with Tabs. Pretty much the same notes. Different locations on the neck. Gonna learn Scotts way too. Playing it more than one way can&#039;t hurt! Thanks Scott! You Da Man!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My choice may not perhaps be the hippest or sexiest song to name drop - the song being You Oughta Know with Capt. Flea on the bass - but the fills and the attack taught me so much (basically been regurgitating them ever since). It&#039;s was hot shit. Still is probably. I&#039;m gonna listen to it right now in fact. Peace out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Isn&#039;t the end of the D7 riff at 14:00 supposed to be eb-d-c-a on the C7?&quot; I think he is correct Scott. And that&#039;s in the Lucas Pickford transcription as well. No offense to you though. As I followed it through with you, I had two other things wrong as well! lol Great that you took this classic on for us!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott! Thanks a lot. I got one remark. Isn&#039;t the end of the D7 riff at 14:00 supposed to be eb-d-c-a on the C7? So that&#039;ll be #9, 9, root, 6. At least that&#039;s what I hear... Cheers!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, as always so very elevating ways of having bassists focusing on the real thing: work. This video reminds me of one of yourprevious releases which I believe was called &quot;a jaco like groove&quot;. Quite a very useful preparation  that video was. Roots is roots. I&#039;m sure the shed will shed a lot of tears...of joy in theend, fo sho :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been working on this for a long time, especially the second phrase (from low F) and the last phrase are troublesome for me. I noticed you use your pinky in shifting? Is this something you would recommend? I had a couple of teachers trying to avoid this because the little finger does not really have much control when shifting. Also, any pointers to getting up to 128BPM? I&#039;m currently at around 110 but feel and precision start to give out...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh yeah, great lesson.


The piece for me was probably Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Iron Maiden back when I was like 14-15.
I&#039;ve mostly played what was playing on the radio along with some blues and country stuff.
So when my band said &quot;Hey, let&#039;s cover a maiden song!&quot;, and brought that one up, I felt so bad for myself. I couldn&#039;t play that, not by a longshot.
I practiced and practiced and then baam, months later I got it, I got it perfectly.
What this tought me was... god damn it&#039;s hard playing the same thing for 10 minutes without messing up, keeping the groove steady, keeping the tones sounds good etc.


Now, 15 years later I kind of have Steve Harris to thank for my way of looking at bass, and for the way I practice. I just practice &#039;till I got it! (unless it&#039;s Heavy Metal cause damn they play so fast with the right hand it&#039;s almost hillarious!).]]></description>
