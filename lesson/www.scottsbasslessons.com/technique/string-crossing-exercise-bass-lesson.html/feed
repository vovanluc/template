		<description><![CDATA[I find if I&#039;m struggling on any given lesson , I do my best , then put it in my favorites and look at the next day and I see things I didn&#039;t see the day before and its like , well that&#039;s why I couldn&#039;t put this together yesterday then it comes together. It happens on almost every bass lesson I&#039;ve learned . I get brain blockage the first time I try to figure it out. Then the following two days its like why did I make this so hard on myself , but it did help my finger strength.
Cant ever get enough finger fretting strength . I did this with Scott , Mark , Paul who are all good bassist and teachers . 
I struggled with this today but tomorrow or the next I fill figure it out .How fast I can play it is another thing, I just need to get it under my fingers for now .]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was trying to figure out why Scott&#039;s method might be superior to the usual method -- i.e., practicing the entire line/lick at a slow tempo, and then gradually increasing the speed until you get to the target tempo -- and then I saw a great answer at TalkBass.com: You might have to alter your technique in (perhaps subtle) ways to play something at a higher tempo than at a slower tempo. It occurred to me, for example, that you might be able to play something at a slower tempo using rest strokes, but have to switch to free strokes to play the same thing at the faster target tempo. If you tried to play the whole line/riff slowly, and gradually increased the tempo, you might at some point hit a wall beyond which you just can&#039;t play it any faster -- and you&#039;d never know why. However, if you start from the beginning using Scott&#039;s method, you have to master whatever technique is required to play the notes at tempo right from the start, and then it&#039;s just a matter of adding all the notes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This lesson would make Billy Sheehan proud! I did translation work at a couple of his seminars and one thing he pointed out is that he&#039;s a good &quot;problem spotter&quot; (and then solver, of course). When you&#039;re trying to pull off a complicated riff or technique, he says it&#039;s no use pushing on if you are clearly struggling with something. He developed his formidable technique because when he encountered a glitch or an obstacle, he was really good at &quot;deconstructing&quot; it, so to speak. Is it the fingering pattern? Is it the string skipping? The plucking hand? Focus on just one issue at a time and then put it back together. It clearly works! ;-)]]></description>
