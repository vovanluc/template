		<description><![CDATA[Great lessons and killer website for bass players, Scott. You got me into practicing again after years of just playing and having purchased a couple of packages from your play-along-series I&#039;m in for loads of work.

I&#039;m gettting into the triplets but I find it so hard get my head around the timing of the whole riff - especially the second part. Need to work on that....

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott!

I love your lesson. They are so much of an inspiration and also get me back to practicing more and more.

But i have a little question too, about slap bass.
When you slap  the A string for example, how do you silence the E stringlg best, so that it does not accidently rings out too?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sweet lesson and great playing!

Just checked your &quot;P bass of doom&quot; video and you said you were using Flatwounds... It would be super duper interesting if you would make a video talking (and playing with!) different kind of strings, like Flatwound and Roundwound etc.

I mostly use the coated Elixir roundwound strings (cause they are great lol) but you probably know your shizzle, so please get in the shed and make the video happen. ;)

Lofve you,

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott
Love your lessons---I ALWAYS pick up something, whether an entire lesson&#039;s worth or just one tid-bit.  Your style is awesome.  Congrats on the new baby (right??)  Question.  I have subscribed and donated but can&#039;t figure out how to download the tabs for the lessons.  When you have a minute, can you help??  Thx!
