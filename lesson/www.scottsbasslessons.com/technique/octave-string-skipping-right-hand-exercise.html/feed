		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, I&#039;m Eduardo from Colombia, I wanna say thank u for your lessons, they are great, I have a question for this video: When you are playing the octaves I notice that your right hand is not always alternating the fingers index-middle-index-middle... I notice that skipping strings you some times repeats right hand finger... so why is that? is there a reason for it or what is the best way to play this exercises, thank u... (Sorry if my English is bad, I speak spanish).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,
If you were playing an octave line just moving from root to octave on the same note say an e on 7th fret on the a string to octave on the 9th fret on the g string, would  you if you started with your middle finger then plucked the g string with your index when you come back to the a string would you then use your index finger then when you went to the octave you would then have to use your middle finger on the g string is that right?   

Cheers

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, just economy of motion really. It helps having a finger per fret when I&#039;m playing faster type lines etc - but it also helps me visualise the harmony on the fretboard too. Scott ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott
Congratulations for this job Scott ! The lessons are very clear and very effective ! It helps me a lot to progress (sorry if my English is bad...) and to understand why I have difficulty on certain technical points.
Concerning this work on the octaves, I noticed that usually you use a finger by fret, for the octaves you tighten your hand. Why ? better position of the hand ?
Thank&#039;s
