		<description><![CDATA[Great Tip! This lesson is a double lesson, though you created it as a shifting exercise it is also an exercise in using the full length of the bass. My issue has always been with using the higher register (above the 12th). This lesson not only teaches how your eyes should move but also the relationship between the two halves of the bass. I have always envisioned the bass as having two parts. The Bass player, low end groove part, and the solo area. But in this lesson you inadvertently showed me an easy way to teach myself the &quot;solo&quot; area of the bass. I would assume that you could also use this lesson as a fretboard learning exercise. It would be a new approach to learning the notes on the FB. Done in every key this is extremely valuable. Thanks for a great lesson.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott: I&#039;m a school trained player, but want to get a whole lot better. I&#039;ve been looking for a teacher around here and haven&#039;t found one. In the interim I found your lessons on youtube, and couldn&#039;t be happier!..You are smart, kind and explain things without being condescending..I&#039;m gonna sign up for your academy and just work on stuff from home. Thanks a million, Tedi May]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazing how the simplest things can transform the way you play.  I&#039;ve not been in a gigging band for a few years now but one old chestnut we used to play was &quot;Alright now&quot; by Free.  Number of times I&#039;ve messed that up (the lick under the guitar solo).  Just picked up the bass and using what you&#039;ve just showed us I&#039;ve played that lick constant for about 3 minutes without a slip up.  So thanks for the tip :-)]]></description>
