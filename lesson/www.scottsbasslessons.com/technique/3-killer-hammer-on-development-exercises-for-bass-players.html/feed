		<description><![CDATA[Nice stuff! And it&#039;s VERY useful for performing bassists, too! It&#039;s not just for the beginners!!
I&#039;m kinda hooked way too much on a &quot;you gotta finger every note&quot; mentality and sometimes (especially when I&#039;m improvising) throwing in more hammer-ons can be a life-saver! ^_^ (ok, well, performance-saver, let&#039;s say... :P )
You know what? To &quot;space out&quot; the hammer-ons and shifts more evenly, I&#039;ve found myself that prefer going like this (referring to your Cmaj scale exercise):
C-D
E-F-G-shift-A
B-C-D
E-F-G-shift-A]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Second day of practice.
Yesterday my fingers were saying: &quot;Sure we can do that&quot; - they couldn&#039;t.
Today they&#039;re saying: &quot;Practice with us a few minutes a day and we&#039;ll get there&quot; - I like their attitude.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Having used hammer ons a lot, I can tell you that applying the right technique is opening doors. If you are using hammer ons and can&#039;t replicate it into a section of music, take a look at this tutorial. Train yourself how to use hammer ons and pulls effectively. Thanks Scott for the clarity on the technique. Now on to breaking some bad habits. :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Scott for such an amazing lesson.  I just has a huge &quot;Ah-Ha&quot; moment!  I never used hammer-ons effectively in the past.  I used them more as ghost notes.  The light went on when you mentioned that the hammer-on note should sound as if is a plucked note.  And, as you mentioned, done correctly, it will improve my speed since I&#039;m not actually plucking every single note.  Again, thanks a million!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey, Scott. Your hammer-on technique adds lots of buzz and sizzles on tone, this is way no good. It can&#039;t be such amazing bass has so crooked neck with buzzy and sizzy strings here/there, it definitely must be your practice... :-P :-D
