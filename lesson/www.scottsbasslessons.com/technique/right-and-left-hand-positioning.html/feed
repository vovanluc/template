		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott (or anybody reading :) ), question on right hand positioning.. well thumb positioning really ;) My thumb has a tendency to point towards the headstock.. i&#039;m trying to iron this out of my technique as I feel its making me grip the neck more with my palm (although I&#039;m also trying to use my arm/shoulder more rather than gripping with my hand..). However, if I religiously try to keep my thumb perpendicular to the headstock I find my hand IS bending in a bad way! 


Where &#039;should&#039; my thumb be pointing? Any advice?


For any other readers, really really take ergonomics seriously.. I played at playing bass for about 6 months when I was younger but stopped (long story probably for another post lol), didn&#039;t have much money to get another bass for a while. By the time I could, I&#039;d bust up my hands/shoulders typing on keyboards in some pretty bad positions. This put me off picking it up again for years. Luckily now that I have I&#039;m not in pain trying to play, but really, it&#039;s not fun having a RSI injury, because of that first word... repetitive :/ it might not present itself as pain in your hand or wrist either. my first serious symptom was my left arm going numb and a pain in my ribcage. A bit embarrassing when you go to hospital and the ECG says there&#039;s nothing wrong with you ;) (though much better than the alternative..).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey, Scott: I soooo relate to the being afraid to ask..I lost the ability to speak for 3 full years, and relearned even though medical doctors said it wasn&#039;t possible..I also learned to sing in the process..And am in a couple of bands now and just put out an album of my originals :-)..But everytime I meet someone, or now sing on stage, or am starting to need to do some interview, I have this fear that I will not sound right or not be able to..But the nice and wonderful thing is to go ahead and do it anyway, and not let fear stop me, and realize people don&#039;t really think about it much or at all, and they want to be happy and entertained just like I do, so just do it : xo]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott!, 

When it comes to my left hand wrist being laid out like yours I tend to have a lot of issues due to my cerebral palsy which makes my muscles tighter and stiff, I also have a similar issue with right hand but not as much, any tips?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scot, i got a problem with middle and ring finger. when i play G string (especially near the nut) the tip of my middle and ring finger is narrowing. and its very hard to play 1 fret 1 finger. i dont have any problem with my index and pinky. i can stretch them from 1st fret to 4th fret easily, but not for my middle and ring finger. any suggestion? thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott! Thank you for the fantastic website. I&#039;m an &quot;old&quot; player but your lessons have helped me break down some barriers I never could break before.

I found a lot of contradicting information on proper thumb positioning at the back of the neck which leaves me not knowing which one to adopt. So my thumb is all over the place! Maybe there&#039;s more than one right way but I&#039;m curious about how you play, for example: 

- is the thumb always pointing upwards ?
- should it move freely (as if it is not touching the neck) or is it ok to anchor it to a degree when playing in just one position?
- if I play from low to high strings is it ok for the thumb to move &quot;down&quot; with the strings as well?
- what finger of your fretting hand is closest to the thumb when you play - 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or it depends?
- if you use your pinky high up the neck, can you prevent the thumb from spilling over or under the neck without making a weird wrist angle?

Cheers!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Scott! Another invaluable video!! I’ve been playing for quite a few years and have found the need to go back and revisit right hand technique (small bit of RSI) , this is a great lesson !]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought the same thing when I watched this video. Now I have no formal training on bass, so take this with a grain of salt, but I&#039;ve found that if you tilt the neck up as you play, bringing your left hand close to your head, it makes the stretch much easier, so you can keep your wrist at the same angle. It makes it weird playing sitting down (I&#039;ve been resting my bass on the side of my leg) and seems pretty unorthodox, but it works, keeps your wrist healthy, and even looks kinda cool. So that&#039;s one method.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott
I&#039;ve been playing now for 40 years but i am excited to retool and advance my playing. i&#039;m starting from the ground up with your beginners lessons (ok some of it i am skipping) and i am finding insightful guidance even down at the very ground level (strap adjustment, hand positions). I wanted to echo another users request for a syllabus in order to chart a course (i guess that is what a syllabus is: a chart for a course) through these generous offerings. Oh and, I donated and received the pdfs, thank you very much! Very excited about this endeavor!]]></description>

Thanks for that advice. I&#039;m a beginner and have be teaching myself for about 3 months are so and I was doing it all wrong with the height and hand position. I&#039;m still having trouble with my right hand position but it is getting better, Thanks for the video, it really did help me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott! Awesome lesson, one question though- I play 4 and 5 string (I&#039;ve been watching all your lessons on stuff I think I know to see if I really know it- it&#039;s been interesting, lol). When I play 5 string, and fret a note on the low B, I feel like my left wrist bends a lot more then it should (to reach the low B). Is that just a fact of life when you play 5 stringers or is there something I haven&#039;t thought of trying to change to bend less?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I starterd looking for vídeos on right hand technique/position. I am one of the player who plays his bass high. I like the bass on my chest as it allows me to feel the resonance of the instrument which helps me a lot actually, and  also because I can reach the entire fretboard with ease. Since it helps me play play better I kept playing that way.  Well, my  right hand has been in pain sometimes when I&#039;m playing, sometimes when I&#039;m not.  I am self taught, so I didn&#039;t know I was doing it wrong. Dang it!  I hope the pain isn&#039;t permanent and that it goes away with the correct posture. It&#039;s really hard relearning this.  Thanks for this video.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott! 
Much love for the amount of info on this sight, keep it up man! 
I imagine dropping your right wrist to rest on the body isn&#039;t proper technique, but I find myself doing it sometimes unconsciously, especially when I&#039;m sitting down. Is this something I need to start focusing on, because I dont want to get into a bad habit later on.
Peace]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hi scott... my problem with playing bass is i have a tendon disease in my left hand which
has left my little finger useless so i can&#039;t stretch it to the fourth fret so i have to slide up and do the little finger fret picking with my third finger... is it still feasable for me to continue playing bass this way.. i guess im asking do you know of bass players who do not use for whatever reason their little finger when they play the bass??
thanks scott]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That technique is fine for people like you that have long fingers but I do not have that luxury, my fingers are short and not very straight making it difficult to spread and reach the frets.
Do you have any techniques or exercisers for people in my position that could help with my playing and help avoid injuries?]]></description>
