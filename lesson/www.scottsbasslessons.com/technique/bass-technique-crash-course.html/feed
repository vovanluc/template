		<description><![CDATA[My issue is fretting hand buzz.  When I left off the fret...there&#039;s a buzz.  It&#039;s not the setup, I&#039;ve just had it setup.  When I hit a note, and start to move onto the next, I get buzz.  Am I to stop the note with the right hand first?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had exactly the same experience!
I ended having tendinitis from &quot;proper&quot; 1 finger per fret (I have fingers with very uneven length, the pinky is unusually short for my hand size so I had to rotate the wrist too much). Only after starting my double bass lessons i was able to overcome the tendinitis and transferred the same technique to the electric bass. No problems since then whatsoever!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Paul, i also have a few 34&quot; scale basses and it&#039;s the same. In fact the different between 33 and 34 in terms of stretching on the fingerboard is super tiny. Thanks for coming along and hanging out man :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually I think the problem is also psychologic. I mean... even if you work out all your relaxed positions and smooth shifts, once you&#039;re on stage you can easily cramp up (in the tricky passages) due to excessive &quot;anticipation&quot;, so to speak. Not necessarily anxiety. I&#039;m a seasoned player, so most of the time I don&#039;t get nervous anymore, but still... when a challenging bit comes up, the &quot;ooh I gotta throw that lick here, and play that gimmicky stuff there! And maybe try a substitution on the way...&quot; mood kicks in and I risk screwing up!
Even if AT HOME you have your exercise down cold.
A good part of playing smoothly comes also from FEELING smooth, let&#039;s say! ;-)
(Needles to say, you DO have to be prepared beforehand... done your homework, that is! ^_^ )


Cheers
