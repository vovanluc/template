		<description><![CDATA[It turns not quite everyone&#039;s fret hand physiology is the same.  I don&#039;t have the tendon in the elbow that keeps the ulnar nerve in place so at a certain bend it jumps out and rolls over the bone.  It kind of saws at the nerve really.  Didn&#039;t bother me years ago when I was gigging but since then I&#039;ve been in a car wreck where my thumb got scrumpled (bent completely back) and a certain antibiotic I was on gave me severe tendinitis and did some nerve damage.  Now my left arm doesn&#039;t really listen to my brain that well but I&#039;m trying to work through it.  There were a couple of things I wanted to mention. 

1. many months after my thumb was scrumpled I attempted playing.  Athletic tape to support it was necessary but would stick to the neck.  A partial glove allowed free movement.  Without knowing of your condition this caused me to click on the first video of yours I came across.

2. ring to pinky hammers my thumb creeps out.  I never noticed this before so thank you!  It&#039;s my worst finger combo, being cognizant of thumb position will help.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have always used my pinkie since i started playing although i experience pain in it sometimes when stretching.
I have also done that very thing where you put your thumb to the side although there was a guy on Youtube who said it was a natural position to take the strain away.
I sometimes get pain in my thumb when playing so maybe i am pressing too hard on the neck.
I also end up in a ridiculous position with my thumb when i play higher up the neck where my thumb bends around into an uncomfortable position, Any tips ?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott this video is so helpful - I make these mistakes with my fretting hand some (most?) of the time and now know what to do to correct it. That coupled with the fretting exercise videos you have posted in the past will really help freshen my technique up and get me to the next level. Much love!]]></description>
