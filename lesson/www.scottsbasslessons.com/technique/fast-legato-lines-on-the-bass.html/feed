		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott! I am having a slight problem here &#062;.&#060; 
I&#039;m really enjoying your lessons, and I&#039;m slowly working my way through the lesson map.

When I got to this lesson I ran into a problem. I&#039;m 17 and my left hand isn&#039;t quite big enough to stretch my fingers out to have one finger per fret. To get my pinky down, I have to lift my index finger. Any suggestions?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Overwater jazz bass is very similar to a jazz sound wise but it&#039;s built a little differently. It has a 33&quot; scale neck instead of a 34&quot; that the finder has. The fingerboard is totally flat with no radius. Oooo... and the string spacing is 16.5mm instead of 19mm. It&#039;s actually kind of a work in progress... I&#039;m in the middle of having a new wenge neck made for it, and I&#039;m thinking about changing the pickups... watch this space... I&#039;ll be posting about it soon!
Ez,
Scott.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I see we have made some nice changes on the website. I like that. Hey, just wanted to say I appreciate all you are doing here. As far as the forum is concerned, I think it is a good thing. Forget those jerks who say things like &quot;all we need is another forum&quot;. These guys sux and they are everywhere. Nothing good to say, just junk. 

I am still looking to improve my finger strength. Ring and pinky finger still sux but getting a little better. I have a question concerning Overwater. How do you compare the four string that you use to a fender jazz? What are the major differences?
Holla at me when you can. I know your are busy and I don&#039;t expect a direct response. Looking forward to the tutorial about recognizing scale patterns on the bass. I am looking for a wall poster that contains the fretboard that I can put on my wall in front of my treadmill. I know that by having it in front of me as I walk will reveal some things that I didn&#039;t realize. If I can find one, I will try to make one myself. Anyway, take care and shout at me later....Stay in the shed........Greg Potts in Alabama]]></description>
