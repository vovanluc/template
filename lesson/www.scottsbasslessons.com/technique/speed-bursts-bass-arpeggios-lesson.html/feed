		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott! Thanks for your lessons mate. You are an inspiration. Some of my most significant leaps have been instigated by you. My journal comes with me wherever I go.


Something I have noticed come up for me lately.....


I normally have one simple rule: Must pick up my bass every day, even if only for 5 mins. Obviously once i pick it up it is a struggle to put it down again :P 
But a few times this year I have been without bass for a few days/weeks at a time. I still brought my journal with me though. My only other rule is to try to write something in my journal every day. Due to this, I have found that there is much that can be practiced without a bass in my hands. Perhaps some of your students might benefit from some ideas in this area.


A few examples:
Draw entire neck (5 lines......add frets)
- mark all notes belonging to Cmaj7 chord (using 1,3,5,7)
- mark all notes belonging to C7 chord (1,3,5,flat7)
- find all C&#039;s.....G&#039;s.......F#&#039;s........A#...... (note location practice)


Draw bass stave
- Try to notate a melody that I can remember
- Notate walking line spelling out chord progression
- Write Tablature to match my notations


Think of a melody (or hear one)
- try to imagine note locations, bring appropriate finger to thumb on left hand.
- Hum intervals.


Some of this stuff used to frighten me until I sat down and looked at it without a bass in my hands.


Just some food for thought :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You do not have to keep holding the C while you play the E. Try shifting your entire hand to land the little finger (keep eyes on target fret, not finger).


I like to try to find as many patterns as possible. Practice them all with a smile. No one pattern is best.


Oh! ......also, your hands are not too small. Impossible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, in this lesson you showed the pattern playing the E on the 12th fret.  Why not play the E on the 7th fret on the A string?  Since I have small hands, it&#039;s a bit of a stretch for me to play the pattern as you showed.  I guess since everyone is not built the same, everyone has to do what is comfortable to achieve the end results, speed, consistency and technique.  However, is there a specific reason for playing the pattern your way?
Great lessons with goals to achieve. I wish you were around 40 years ago! It&#039;s like I&#039;m learning all over again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This was timely for me as well, as I&#039;ve recently been focusing on trying to increase my speed on arpeggios and other kinds of patterns that involve a lot of string-crossing and/or left-hand shifting. This idea of adding one note at a time while practicing a riff at speed is one of those ideas that seems completely obvious in retrospect, but that hadn&#039;t occurred to me in &quot;pro-spect.&quot; 


This lesson also served the secondary function for me of identifying technique problems that hadn&#039;t been obvious previously. Specifically, doing this exercise called (loudly) to my attention to the fact that when I try to reverse the riff and play it descending, I sometimes stick to alternate picking with my plucking fingers but sometimes rake. If I remember correctly from other lessons, Scott&#039;s view on this is that both strict alternation and raking are okay, depending on context and provided that you can control which you&#039;re using at a given time. My problem is that I don&#039;t have control over that: Sometimes my fingers do one and sometimes the other, and as a result they often get tied up in knots trying to decide. So back to the woodshed I go.... Thanks again, Scott!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I also play (when on a P) with my thumb either on the pickup or the very end of the neck (if I&#039;m going for a round reggae sound) and after practicing the &quot;moving thumb&quot; technique for a week or so, then I put my thumb back on the pickup for a song where I need to really dig in, and it&#039;s much more comfortable. Guess it takes more than a week to make up for years of habit!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always played with my thumb resting on the pickup. I&#039;d noticed your thumb doesn&#039;t and moves around with you.  Thought it was just a preference thing, but this is very interesting :-) will give it a Try! Cheers mate, very helpful x]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I was making the thumb mistake all the time!. I can go up the fingerboard pretty fast, but going down becomes a mess, and sometimes a hell.  My thumb was stuck there, I knew it, but didn&#039;t realised it had to be with my lack of speed. Thanks to you and to this exercise I know I have to focus my work on correcting my right hand technique. Apart from this exercises, do you have any advice to fix the thumb problem?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scot,

Your timing is perfect. I have just started to work on Muse&#039;s Knights of Cydonia and the 3 arpegios about halfway through the song are killing me. This exercice and a bit of time should do the trick.]]></description>
