		<description><![CDATA[The same note can be played in many different places on the neck, and where one plays that note depends on the path of one&#039;s line (among other considerations).  I suspect that Scott didn&#039;t create the tablature, and whoever did just assumed the lowest position for each note.  Which is not entirely accurate for where Scott actually did play it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, this kind of material is exactly what I&#039;m looking for -- thank you!  After reading/listening to the chart/mp3, it&#039;s 180 to the 8th note (hi-hat) not quarters, which means that your groove shoulda been charted out in 16th notes (12-bar blues form) not 8ths (24-bar). Then this transcription material will line up better with how your &quot;groove formula&quot; is designed (around 16th notes).  Perhaps you already knew this, and chose to &quot;simplify&quot; the notation for beginners?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with you, FullCents.  I guess he&#039;s transposing the simple riffs that are in the tablature, and that&#039;s why it&#039;s a &quot;lead sheet&quot;.  But I&#039;d love to have an explanation of that process.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ok. I am a rank beginner, but this is something that alludes me.  How can you have a TAB (off the Leadsheet) that starts off on the E string, third position and then watch Scott as he is playing the same song in the middle of the neck and higher?  I don&#039;t see the connection. Is it simply over my head at this point.  Do I need a great deal more schooling in the art of music? Confused.  Volunteers for advice?]]></description>
