		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott

When i look at your left hand at 09:35, your hand don&#039;t move ! just you finger move a little. Me, it is catastrophic !

When the little finger press on a string, all the other fingers rise up automatically (sorry for my bad English). If I force myself to leave them in position (pressed on strings), the string where is my little finger &quot;friezes&quot; (i don&#039;t know if you use this word in English !). Why !

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been playing bass for about 10 years now and I&#039;ve been pretty successful. Been in a jazz band or so. Played a show or two. I&#039;ve not been taught a lot and have struggled to find practical musical knowledge (mostly because I was too shy to ask and had a bunch of smart-ass peers haha). I had to say how awesome this site is. Great theory information. Great ways to exercise it. Great ways to apply it. Thanks a ton, Scott.]]></description>

Thanks,

		<description><![CDATA[Scott,
One thing is to tell players to always start on the 1st scale note of the scale on the first beat!!!???
Or you know what I&#039;m trying to say. Or end on the first note as you lead to into the first note of the playing!!!???   Great lesson but it&#039;s one thing I saw that wasn&#039;t indicated.]]></description>
