		<description><![CDATA[Scott, I just want to thank you so much. I have been playing bass for 2 years and I didn&#039;t make any progress. I also stopped feel playing the bass as much as I did it before. I do not know how you made it, but you have returned me that feeling of playing, that sense, enjoying. Thank you very much Scott! You are pretty awesome, teach!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yep - you&#039;ve got it! As with anything, it&#039;s the way you do it that counts... sometimes just throwing it in there will sound wrong even if it is harmonically correct. So... a bit like salt... use sparingly and it can do a great job! ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott, great lesson but I have a quick question about it. In the video you displaced the root and used the 3rd instead. Could the same principle apply for the 5th or any other notes in the chord? In other words, can you displace the root with any of the notes in the chord?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great videos scott!! So when you do your route displacement and go onto the 3rd what notes are you allowed to play from there? Do you treat the 3rd as if it was a root note and play notes of that note&#039;s lets say major scale? alex]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have to agree with everything Israel said.  you&#039;re a phenomenal teacher, and use the best approach to video bass teaching I&#039;ve seen on the web.  I cant thank you enough Scott! You deserve the money Im sending you, as ive gotten more out of your stuff then Ive gotten from my bass teacher in all February.   Scott, you probably get asked this hundreds of times so i apologize, but im curious... do you wear the glove on your fretting hand d/t sensitive skin? if this is too personal just ignore the question. I love the look of your 4 string too.. looks like a sadowsky, but it must be a Brit. made bass because i dont think ive seen it in the states. Again, Thank You for all your time and hard work Scott. i sincerely hope this website pays off for you!]]></description>
