		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad you covered this core stuff again. It&#039;s so important. I practically make a living knowing just these basic techniques. But you taught me something new with the bit about chromatic approaches to the next chord. Speaking of chords, anyone know where to find the lesson on playing chords? There&#039;s one about striking 2-3 strings at a time like Scott does in the beginning of this lesson, but I can&#039;t find it again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Recommendations for further videos: could you make a video where you unpack how you create lines (exampe - starts at 9:47 with root notes). I don&#039;t mean the specific lines you played, but in general - how does one go about doing it (thought process / actions). I&#039;m been on bass for seven months and am just beginning to get into this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott. At time 4.50 of the lesson, you want to play II-V-I progression in the Em scale, but you play chords of Emaj, don&#039;t you?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[this is the most interesting bass lesson and piece of advice i have ever had.
i got that idea from the seminar&#039;s first lesson and it´s great to be able to start learning from that concept 
of 2-5-1 and go beyond with all the rest of music theory related to that, really good idea indeed!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good lesson Scott. In the 1st half of your lesson, you play a bunch of ii-V7-I harmonic progressions in C, G, Db, E, etc... However, your voice leading would be more powerful if you resolved the 3rd in the V7 chord (solfa TI leading tone) upward to the root rather than holding that pitch as the major 7th in the I chord.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott, thank you for all the amazing knowledge you&#039;re spreading here. AMAZING!! You mentioned you&#039;re always looking lesson topics..... The passing of Prince inspired me  to transcribe the guitar solo of Sexy M.F on bass, trying to analyze it, what scales etc. I got somewhat far but I am curious how you would approach it and what you&#039;d squeeze out of it. Its one of my fave 20 seconds of music out there. Maybe you&#039;ll find time to slip it in. Cheers!!]]></description>
