		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, that&#039;s true. 
I was able to slow down the vid I had bought with Rocco and it was really cool to see the fingering at 35% the original speed.
Even at that speed I can&#039;t play it as well as he does ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually I was wrong :(

I looked at that video again and, although he mentions playing octaves with the index finger in some part of the vid, when he plays this tune he does play the octave with the middle finger. Scott got it right on!

Thanks for this great lesson and reminding me that I had that vid somewhere in my archives :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you 1jgjgjg.  I had a look and I think I&#039;d like to get it for the transcribing help.  But I&#039;m not sure how I could get Scott&#039;s videos loaded in.  I would have to figure out how to get his video on my hard drive, and assuming that&#039;s possible, I suspect I would be stealing his content!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This reminds me of The Lemon Song. Oh, John Paul Jones. This is an awesome recording of a pretty bad (relatively!) performance. Still wickedly wicked: 
https://youtu.be/_g8exqCq-0w?t=2m38s
Rocco? oh please. 

This is the studio recording: 
https://youtu.be/Zyhu2ysqKGk?t=1m31s
oh man. 

(strangely enough, the best live performances of this song are not Led Zep&#039;s but Jimmy Page with the black Crowes, and the two excellent bassists Sven Pipien and Greg Rzab.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks as always for fun and insightful stuff, Scott.  It would be great if you had some kind of video embedding tool that allowed us to loop/cycle a few seconds of your work, like DAWs can do, to hear the lick over and over and watch both of your hands.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is one of the hardest tracks I had to learn to play it correctly! Rocco is a &quot;tricky&quot; bassist... He&#039;s my favorite with Jaco.
Great job as always, Scott! You&#039;re awesome!
PS.: are we sharing the same passion with Superdry apparel too? I&#039;m addicted to that brand!!! :D :D :D]]></description>
