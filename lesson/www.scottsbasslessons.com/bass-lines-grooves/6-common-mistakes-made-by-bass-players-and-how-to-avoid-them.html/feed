		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the reply Scott.
It only occurs on those two frets for some reason so it maybe that the truss rod might need heightening because the action is a bit low but i&#039;m no expert.
When i play the D string to fret E on the second fret i find that if i cover the E String and A String with a bit of my palm it eliminates the ringing.
I am trying to do that whole Garry Willis approach to muting where your wrist and a part of your fore arm stay on the face of the Bass all the time and your arm is straight opposed to some people who seem to bend their wrist in a very awkward position on top of the Bass.


I&#039;ll just stick at it and i&#039;ll get there in the end as always.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have a question about the finger stacking/support technique. What if you have to do a big stretch in a riff, like 3 to 6 to 7 or something like that. Is it okay to release your finger(s) from the lower frets when you go to reach the higher ones?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The advice to support a fretting hand finger with those behind it is something with which I might struggle. I&#039;m a long time guitarist and new bass player, and have drilled my fingers to relax as the next one takes over, in order to reduce tension and facilitate speed. What is it that makes it good guitar technique but bad bass technique?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I believe that it does matter, because at some point you will beging to play at gigs. Then you will suddenly face a whole new kind of problems, concerning your stage presence. You have to be able to play that much freely and fluently that even under pressure you won&#039;t start to make weird face tics. Of course, this just my subjective way to look at it.
There is actually one more reason to practice once in a while in front of a mirror:
You have to get comfortable in recognizing in which position the player&#039;s hand is on the fretboard, from an outsider&#039;s point of view. 
Unfortunately in most gigs you won&#039;t be able to actually hear what your fellow guitar players are playing. Maybe you won&#039;t be able to even hear yourself. I feel that it is important to be able to tell that you are synchronized with your bandmates with just a glimpse to their left hand.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey man, thanks for watching. Without seeing you play it&#039;s impossible for me to determine what&#039;s going on. My guess is that it could be unwanted harmonics ringing out... if that is the case, make sure you&#039;ve got some decent fretting hand muting going on, as plucking hand muting is only half of the picture. Hope that helps man, S :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[number 4 is very important when you play fretless! (unless you want to do a cello like vibrato on a note) it helps big time on your intonation on fretless, even when you practice it correctly on your fretted bass (same scale, preferable even same bass!) and putting your fingers nice in position all right before the frets. Your hand will learn better keeping that shape in all positions, and that&#039;s a true benefit.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, In relation to muting i place my thumb near the second pick up which eliminates virtually all unwanted noise.
I am left handed so i have a tendency for my hand to move to the right naturally.
Now that i want to try playing closer to the first pick up i find i get a lot of harmonic ringing especially from E on the D String Second Fret and A on the D String 7th fret.
This occurs even though my thumb is over the E String and A String and it&#039;s so annoying to get this when your playing something.
Is there any way of stopping this ?
So far i have tried placing the back edge of my palm on the strings which works with varying success which i call keeping the back door closed and an extra insurance policy.
Should i persist with this or am i doing the wrong thing ?]]></description>
