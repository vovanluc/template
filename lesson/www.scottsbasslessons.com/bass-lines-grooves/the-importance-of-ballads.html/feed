		<description><![CDATA[I love playing ballads, but the band has to be *tight*. Some people just can&#039;t hold the form well. I&#039;m pretty decent at it but could always be better. Any suggestions for good exercises for this? ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this site Scott. I&#039;m a long time guitarist diving in the deep end. Really enjoy your tips on the elements of tone etc that are more Bass than guitar and loving the fact that playing Bass is forcing me to learn the names of the notes in the chords I have played for years on the guitar. I love playing Ballads and Jazz standards so this was a very appropriate lesson for me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, for me it&#039;s still difficult to play all chordtones over the entire neck. So I&#039;m now playing an A minor pentatonic scale over all these chords. I don&#039;t now if it&#039;s correct, but it sounds great.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[that was the first lesson i&#039;ve watched in a few months - i&#039;ve been practising as a part of my routine your tips on walking basslines, and it&#039;s awesome to see the consistency of your approach, ie. building from roots to root/fifths, to root/fifth/thirds, etc... As a new bass player, thanks for demystifying so much with your clarity of approach!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The C# is the major third of A, as you writes. This turns VIm into V of IIm. That is, it turns Am into the dominant chord of Dm: A7 - Dm. This can be done with chords on all scale degrees in C major, eg., Em: E7 - Am. Even the I chord can be turned into a V chord by adding the 7 (minor 7): C7 - F, so it becomes the V chord of F. Give a shot in your own progressions :)]]></description>
