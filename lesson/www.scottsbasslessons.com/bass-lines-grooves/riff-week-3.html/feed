account, but it would be a cool way to follow the music you dig and reference in &quot;Album of the Week.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Album of the week sounds great, but would it be more of a discussion clip or will you play some bits and pieces of it? anyways, it does sound as a good idea, as you said to shed some light on the talented bass players that usually don&#039;t get much of the credit hehe...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think a full song and a few riffs is an excellent idea.  You can get a feel for the players style and also be learning at least four new songs a month!  Would love to see players from Jaco to Jamerson and everyone in-between.  Maybe at times the weekly lesson could coincide with the full length song.  Learn something new and have a full song to practice too and see how it applies in the context of a full band.  Thanks Scott.  It&#039;s amazing what you do here.  You have really helped my playing and really motivated me as well to have a regular practice schedule.  It&#039;s incredible to see the arc that starts to happen even after just a couple weeks of being disciplined.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great stuff Scott, helps a lot, I still have a lot of work to do, cause when i try soloing, well, sounds like it&#039;s always the same...... and i&#039;m not very please with what i do. But you are of a great help, now I start to understand bits and pieces, and that&#039;s really cool. Great idea the album of the week, would it be any style ? Could it be possible for you to explain how the bass line was constructed ? Anyway thanks a lot for all you&#039;re doing. Cheers. Could it be possible to see some vidéos of you playing live ? Others than the ones you put in the SLB ? :-)]]></description>
