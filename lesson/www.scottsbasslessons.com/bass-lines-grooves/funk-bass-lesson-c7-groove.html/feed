		<description><![CDATA[Yes, I agree. I was wondering which finger of the RH is playing the ghost notes on the A string. I&#039;ve tried it a variety of ways, but I&#039;d like to know what you are doing. Great lesson—thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Greetings from Lebanon!
Your site has been incredibly helpful to me.Just wanted to say thank you.I don&#039;t think anyone ever explained stuff like this or the creation of  walking bass lines ( MORE of that PLZ) as simply and enjoyable as you are doing.(Not on the web at least)
I cant really use paypal in my country so i&#039;m sticking with that as an excuse for not making a donation ;)

Ps:I read about the disease you have and why you wear gloves , good luck with that.But i must say the gloves look sweet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott,

I take weekly lessons.  Approaching 50 but hoping old dogs can learn new tricks.  Your lessons and tabs are fantastic together with in person lessons.  Please keep up the great work.  I was more than happy to donate $20 as well.

... back to the shed!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, wow! really digging your site, your story is inspirational and your teaching style is great. This C7 funk groove is kicking my butt though I have to say that when I first heard it I was sure that I was not gonna be able to play past the first part. But with a little perseverance and your great teaching style I&#039;m about 90% there and this in only 2 consecutive days of practice.  Keep up the good work!]]></description>
