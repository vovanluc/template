		<description><![CDATA[This lesson could have been broken down into at least 4 lessons.  As a teacher of another subject I&#039;ve learned after 34 yrs to keep lessons as simple as possible without going off into tangents.  When so much info is given in such a short lesson it&#039;s like trying to drink from a firehose.  On the other hand, I&#039;m not a trained musician so maybe this lesson was designed for Juilliard students.  I do enjoy watching you play though so in that regard it&#039;s entertaining.]]></description>
