<p>Ok… let’s talk GOSPEL CHOPS!</p>
<p>We’ve all heard epic gospel players such as Sharay Reed, Justin Raines and Fred Hammond tearing it up with those crazy sounding gospel bass fills…</p>
<p>And let’s get it straight… we ALL want to get those into our playing, right?! ;)</p>
<p><b>Well, in this lesson I’m going to show you: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>How to work those gospel style bass fills into your playing</li>
<li>2 scales you can use to achieve that gospel sound</li>
<li>And an AWESOME exercise that will enable you to get your hammer-ons and pull-offs together (this is a big deal for getting the correct feel within your gospel style bass fills)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Ok… question for you guys…</b></p>
<p>Who are your favourite gospel bass players… and what albums with them playing on should I check out? As you can imagine… I’m a TOTAL bass nerd and love finding out about what and who you guys are listening too… make sure you let me know by leaving a comment below the video!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<p>PS. If you didn't already hear, in under a week, I'm going to be releasing "The Beginning Jazz Survival Guide for Bassists" course into the Academy course library here at SBL.</p>
<p>I've taken everything you need to know to really get you going with jazz... and I've put it all in one course. And honestly, I think this course is one of the most actionable and focused courses I've ever created. In short, if you work through the materials and exercises in the course, it's going to have a HUGE effect on your bass playing - and I can say that without a shadow of a doubt.</p>
<p>Over the last 3 years we've released many courses into the Academy at SBL... over 50 hours worth of content. But this new jazz course is probably the one I'm most proud of because this is the one I REALLY wish I'd had when I was trying to get into jazz.</p>
<p>If you're not an Academy member yet, you can grab your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy" target="_blank">14 day free trial by clicking here.</a></p>

<p>===</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to teach you one of my all time favourite synth style bass lines - "Deeper Underground" by Jamiroquai.</p>
<p>But there's more to it than just teaching you a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/quick-riff/pino-palladino-quick-riff.html" target="_blank">great riff</a>!</p>
<p>One of the questions I get asked time and time again is "How do you do those cool little squiggles... when you slide really fast with one finger between two frets"...</p>
<p>Well the great thing about Deeper Underground is that, by learning the riff, you're going to learn exactly how to achieve these 'squiggles' (also commonly know as '<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/sting-technique-add-grease-bass-fills-grooves-l191.html" target="_blank">stings</a>') as you have to learn how to use them to play the riff correctly.</p>
<p>There are a couple of cool tricks I'm going to show you in this lesson to achieve the right sound when you use this <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/killer-exercise-to-build-your-technique-205.html" target="_blank">technique</a>. They're pretty simple - but not that obvious when you first start trying to master it.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/sweeping-lick-pdf">Non Academy members can grab the PDF with Tab and Notation by clicking here.</a></p>
<p>===</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I uploaded a short video to the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/scottsbasslessons/" target="_blank">SBL Instagram channel</a> where I was playing a fast <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/walking-bass-substitutions-todd-johnson.html" target="_blank">jazz</a> style sweeping <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/quick-lick/modern-jazz-style-lick-quick-riff-201.html" target="_blank">lick</a> (a technique usually associated with Guitar).</p>
<p>A few days later I'd received nearly 30 direct messages on Instagram asking me, I quote... "What the heck was that sweeping lick you just played?!"...</p>
<p>So, I figured it'd be fun to break it down for you and show you exactly how I'm achieving that kind of sound and <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/the-ultimate-speed-exercise-for-bass-players.html" target="_blank">speed</a> (hint: it's a lot to do with <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/3-killer-hammer-on-development-exercises-for-bass-players.html" target="_blank">hammer ons</a>, pull off's and raking).</p>
<p>If you're into jazz style licks, playing 'out', and generally getting your shred on - this lesson is for you!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. There's some REALLY exciting stuff coming up that you're going to want to keep a look out for...</p>
<p>We're going to be doing some insanely cool giveaways over the next few weeks, we've got some great <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/online-video-bass-lessons" target="_blank">lessons</a> and <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/podcast" target="_blank">podcasts</a> lined up for you, we're releasing another course into the Academy - plus - in October we'll be switching the entire Academy platform over to a brand new design which we've been working on for the last 5 months... it will turn the Academy into a 'next level' online education platform. Seriously. Cant' wait for you guys to check it out... so, keep a look out!</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>Learning and studying Latin-style bass lines can be a fantastic way to develop the rhythmic side of your bass playing.</p>
<p>Latin jazz, salsa and timba all stem from Latin and African rhythms - I'm simply crazy for the stuff, and studying it has had a profound effect on my bass playing. </p>
<p>So, I thought it'd be fun to share a Latin-style bass play-along from the Academy with you... so you can give it a go yourself! </p>
<p>I've recorded a video of me performing the song as a  reference for you. You can download the backing track (without bass) and lead sheet below.</p>
<p>In case you want to investigate this style of music a little more, you need to check these bass players out: </p>
<ul>
<li>Israel “Cachao” Lopez</li>
<li>John Benitez </li>
<li>Andy Gonzalez </li>
<li>John Peña </li>
<li>Alain Perez </li>
<li>Anthony Jackson (love his playing with Michel Camillo) </li>
<li>Lincoln Goines </li>
<li>Oscar Cartaya</li>
<li>Alvaro Benavides (check him out with the Pedrito Martinez Group) </li>
<li>Panagiotis Andreou</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...Scott :)</p>

<p>PS. We've got an entire play-along library within the Academy (which this new play-along has been taken from). There's play-alongs in all styles ranging from funk to country, plus each play along has a video performance reference video too.

<p>===</p>
<p>In this new lesson I'm going to be looking at the construction of two bass lines by the insanely talented bass player, Will Lee. </p>
<p>I chose these two bass lines as they use chord and scale tones... but DON'T just sound like you're running up and down a scale or an arpeggio - this is something that soooo many bass players struggle with when creating their own bass lines and grooves.</p>
<p><strong>In this lesson you're going to learn:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How to use shape and contour within your bass lines.</li>
<li>How to start skipping intervals within the chord to give your groove a more open sound.</li>
<li>Two Will Lee riffs - including how and why they work from a theoretical stand point.</li>
<li>And, as always, heaps more...</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. Remember... the first SBL publication of iBass Magazine is coming on July 1st... with none other than Will Lee on the cover! </p>
<p>Keep a look out for it... but until then, make sure you've grabbed the FREE Marcus Miller issue we published just a few days ago. To get your free copy, <a href="http://ibassmag.com/" target="_blank">click here and enter your email address</a> - we'll then send you your special download link for the mag! </p>

<p>A few weeks ago I shared a play-along track from our Play-Along library within the Academy here at Scott's Bass Lessons. We ended up getting so many thank you emails coming in from the SBL community that I thought it'd be fun to share another one with you guys...</p>
<p>Each play-along track within the Academy comes with a "bass-less" MP3, a lead sheet, and a video reference guide showing someone actually playing the song.</p>
<p>The play-along library is a crucial part of the Academy, as using play-alongs can be a fantastic way to make sure you're actually learning songs (which is SUPER important) - not just running scales and arpeggios up and down the neck all day!</p>
<p>You get the "bass-less" MP3, the lead sheet, plus I've recorded a video of myself performing the track for you, so you can get an idea of how to open up on a song such as this.</p>
<p>This new play-along is based on the "So What" or "Impressions" chord sequence, so it'll be a fantastic exercise in how to keep to a form... too many bass players get lost on this simple sequence - make sure you're not one of them! ;)</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

<p>You get the "bass-less" MP3, the lead sheet, plus I've recorded a video of myself performing the track for you so you can get an idea of how to open up on a song such as this.</p>
<p>It's based on the must know song "All Blues" by Miles Davis... and we've added some serious funk vibes in there for you too!</p>

<p>In this lesson I'm going to show you one of (if not 'the') most important chord sequences I have ever learned.</p>
<p>If you haven't noticed yet - most songs are built from the same types of chord movements... and learning these will be HUGE for your bass playing and overall musicianship.</p>
<p><strong>In this lesson you're going to learn:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One of the most important chord sequences you'll ever learn</li>
<li>Why you should be focusing regularly on common chord movements - and what they are</li>
<li>Why we use numbers to explain chord sequences (and how it works)</li>
<li>Why recognition of common chord sequences will be AMAZING for your ear training</li>
<li>Why and how to implement arpeggios and scales over these sequences</li>
<li>How to develop your soloing vocabulary over these sequences</li>
<li>Bass line creation over common sequences</li>
<li>And loads more...</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>To really push your playing to the next level, being able to <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/how-to-unlock-your-bass-fingerboard-epic-scale-exercise.html" target="_blank">visualise the available chord tones</a> (arpeggios) and scales around the neck at the drop of a hat is what you should be aiming for. It's going to take some work and dedication, but if you keep consistently practicing exercises such as the one you're going to learn in this lesson - you'll get there.</p>
<p>In this lesson you'll be learning an exercise that will show you an easy way to start gaining more freedom and better visualisation around the fretboard by simply mixing your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/unlock-fretboard-must-see-lesson-bass-players.html" target="_blank">arpeggio patterns</a> - i.e. by not playing the same ascending and descending patterns within the same pass.</p>
<p>The concept is actually super simple... but like with most things, it's sometimes the simplest things that can make the biggest differences.</p>
<p>Hey, and if your a more advanced player... don't worry... this exercise will certainly keep you on your toes too ;)</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. Groove on!</p>
