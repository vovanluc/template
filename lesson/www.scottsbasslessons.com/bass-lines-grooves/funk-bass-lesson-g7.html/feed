		<description><![CDATA[Hello, Scott, I found out about your cool site 7 days ago. It&#039;s absolutely awesome and you&#039;re an awesome teacher.
Few words about myself: I am 33 years old and I consider myself advanced bass player technique wise, but I lack inspiration and musical knowledge to improve. That&#039;s the main reason I even stopped playing bass after more than 10 years of playing.
Well, that was before I learned about you. Not only that I can learn a lot from your videos but I also find your approach inspirational and, to tell you the truth, it got me back to practicing again, and I am enjoying it. Tnx a lot, mate. 
P.S. Please, make more videos featuring your awesome funky grooves. :)

Love and respect!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,

A brilliant lesson again! It is really useful the way you teach! Could share the back track? I practice the basseline using the metronome but you know, is better following a real drum and the chords playing by the synth...

Thanks again mate!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, I found out about you thru YouTube and that was a stellar moment for me. I&#039;ve learned so much and one of the big bad habits I was in was trying to always learn the whole lick at once. Your teaching is to break it down and this has worked so well. I used to think I wasn&#039;t competent because I couldn&#039;t catch the whole lick at once. I now break these things down and eork them out on the metronome to insure the timing before I move on. Thanks!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott
Why do you say this is most important bass lesson you ever teach? I&#039;m still a beginner so consider some of the licks on this vid hard anyway. Also do you have to be logged in or something to download the tab or backing tracks as I can&#039;t see any links.
Cheers
Phil]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, your lessons are fantastic. 20+ years bassist here trying to un-learn lazy technique to expand my playing.

One problem I&#039;ve got is I&#039;ve never developed the use of the third finger on my left hand, so the hammer-on pull-off technique you&#039;re playing at around 10 mins in the video is proving difficult. Any tips on improving independence and strength in this finger would be very gratefully received.

Cheers buddy &#038; keep on keeping on!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great lesson but I really like it when you describe the notes as  root. Flat 5  3rd etc it helped play in other keys
That riff at 18:50 ans 19:05 sounds so much better when you do it. What are the dynamics behind it?]]></description>
