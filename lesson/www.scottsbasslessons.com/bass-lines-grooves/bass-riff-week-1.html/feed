		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott! Love your work!!

I would like to see more lessons on how to apply theory/scales/modes to riffs/grooves.

It&#039;s always seemed to me that scales/modes were little more than finger exercises - when the rubber hits the road it always seems that all I end up using are arpeggios or the major pentatonic. i know that i am missing something, but i can&#039;t quite put my finger on it.

I would love to learn to create grooves that don&#039;t just follow the chord patterns, but mine always sound like scale and arpeggio exercises! (root-3rd-5th-7th-shift!)

Thanks again - please keep up the great lessons!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Firstly I think this idea is awesome! Secondly, I&#039;d love a tutorial or even just some advice on pedals and amps. I&#039;ve been playing for a while and quite recently bought an EQ pedal. Any help on where to go next and experimenting with different sounds would be awesome!!:) ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree.  I picked a song with no bass in it.  Israel Kamakawiwoli &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow / Wonderful World&quot; and thought - He didn&#039;t use a bass, I wonder if I could create a bass line that would be tasteful, in the right style, and ADD something to the recording - such that Israel might have said, &quot;Yeah - let&#039;s use it.&quot;  So far it feels good when I play it, but it doesn&#039;t really playback (to me) with a good feeling.  If I had other students to compare with, that would be fun.  Perhaps you and I, Mark, could share tracks on that song - if it doesn&#039;t come back as an SBL weekly (or monthly) challenge...

		<description><![CDATA[Cool. I&#039;ve been playing for 40 years now. When I play my upright I play a riff in the lowest position take it up an octave then take it up another octave. on the electric bass take the riff up until you run out of neck then drop it down an octave to finish the riff. This will help you understand your instrument better. Cheers!]]></description>
