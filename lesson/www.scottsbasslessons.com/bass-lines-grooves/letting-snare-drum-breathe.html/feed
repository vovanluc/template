		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott,

On behalf of myself and all the people I play with - THANK YOU!!
Your videos are the real good stuff and I&#039;m enjoying taking one up almost every day.
One comment I have is that your bass&#039;s volume is often a little to low and it&#039;s hard to follow.

Thanks for the time and effort.
If you ever come to Israel, we&#039;ll jam together!!
All the best
