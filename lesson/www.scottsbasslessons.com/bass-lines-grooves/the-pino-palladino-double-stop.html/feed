		<description><![CDATA[Josh, a 6th (or 13th) is a great note to help outline qualities of a major or dominant chord in a bassline without having to go too obvious with a major third. I found it out by trial-and-error when there wasn&#039;t much access to great educators like Scott in my area (i.e. before internets) and later realized it was much used by some of the greatest in a very effective way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott - nice challenging lesson. This is the first time I&#039;ve attempted the double stop technique and I&#039;m finding it quite hard work getting the hammer-on under control - the muscles and tendons in my forearm are squealing a bit - especially when bridging the D &#038; G strings. Do you have any recommendations for exercises or advice that can improve this area?
Cheers.

		<description><![CDATA[One of the many great things about Scott is that the grroves are able to be done by players at many different skill levels and sound cool doing it. Unlike many, Scott provides us not just with the groove but the opportunity and motivation to try them around different chord framing. Have you noticed the smoothness in his approach. It isn&#039;t jumpy. It&#039;s smooth and yet funky at the same time.]]></description>
