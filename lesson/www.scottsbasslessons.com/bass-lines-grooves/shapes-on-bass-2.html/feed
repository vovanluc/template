		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott - really good lesson again but having played around with this for a little while I&#039;ve realised that by adding in the 9th and the 13th of the Em scale you end up playing the Dmaj scale .... what&#039;s going on there? Have I taken a wrong turn somewhere?
All the best.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hi Scott

Lessons are great however I do find your left hand fingering a bit too subtle to follow some times.
It would make it a bit easier if you played less subtle a few times through a riff so that it could be followed more easily. 

Thanks

Shas-O

P.S. Maybe I should just go find my glasses :)]]></description>
