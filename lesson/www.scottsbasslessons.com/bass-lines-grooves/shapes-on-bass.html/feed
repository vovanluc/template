This is always how I thought about playing bass --  but never had anyone teach me the modes and chords or simplify the patterns!  This has made my playing take an enormous leap ahead!  THANK YOU!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK Scott I must be a meatball but I can&#039;t seem to find this backing track or tab in the backstage pass area. This is the second one I&#039;m missing so it HAS to be the tool between the chair and the keyboard of my laptop HAHAHA. I&#039;m just loving your stuff and it&#039;s making me want to practice so MUCH MORE! I had a session last night with a mate and he told me that I have totally improved leaps and bounds since our last session. Thank you Scott and I want to learn more :)]]></description>

I only subscribed today but already you have made me want to practice and become an allround better player. Your lay mans terms are so simple to grasp. Why have I not visited here before. I now of course am finding it hard to not do to much in one session AND leave the site. Thanx a million.]]></description>
