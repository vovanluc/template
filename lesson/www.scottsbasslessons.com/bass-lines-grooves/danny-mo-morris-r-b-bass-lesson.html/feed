		<description><![CDATA[Yes.  Me too.  Watched it on my phone the first time.  The second time too, but held the phone speaker right up to my ear and the bass became much easier to hear.  Then from the laptop, sending video to a TV and audio to a PA and it sounded and viewed really good!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[He&#039;s using left-handed muting where his index finger is fretting and the other fingers are muting.  It makes for a lot of left-hand movement, but he&#039;s just shifting that left-hand shape around on every note.  On the open E, it looks like he&#039;s just placing his index finger over the nut so that his muting fingers get the same muting position and therefore sound on the open E.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought this guy was going to be black as his name is mo morris lol but nope i was wrong, His playing is incredible what the heck am i doing on the bass I am moving around like my bass is a hot potato and I have to get from fret to fret before i burn my fingers :P, he doesn&#039;t moves his fingers he seems to keep them all together, I much prefer to play this then the root note of every chord like some bass music does, Very nice lesson I will practice this over and over till I can at least do it some justice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, Danny was using a mute style playing to give the bass the tone he wanted for this lesson...  That&#039;s how I see it.  Sometimes you don&#039;t want the bass notes just ringing out, they would overlap the next note, that is when playing arpeggios, the notes happen so quickly that some muting is necessary.  Hey I&#039;m not a wizard at bass playing like Scott, but take the lesson for what it is, and that is, it was a great demo on &quot;how to&quot; apply yourself....  Thanks Danny and Scott]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is it just me or does anyone else have trouble with this video in terms of hearing the bass lines. It sounds like the music track is higher in the mix than the bass. Can that be fixed? Or is there something I can do to boost the bass volume?
