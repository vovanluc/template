		<description><![CDATA[Really good comments here from the other players. And of course Scott your lesson is spot on. I would just add don&#039;t volunteer for what you can&#039;t fulfill. In my case I am getting offers to play with groups around town but I am still fully working my day job 40+ hours a week. To mislead them and say I can fill gigs and then back out will ruin my reputation and their gigs both.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve auditioned, but a couple of lessons I learnt the hard way were &#039;If you&#039;re not given material to prepare with, keep it simple&#039; - too many notes lost me a tour with a great blues guitarist.   And if they ask for backing vocals, ask which harmonies - the high parts in Bee Gees disco were way beyond my range!


And, well you asked for stories :-) - A local club&#039;s resident band was auditioning bass players and drummers.  We were all shown into the waiting room to await our turns. One drummer brought his girlfriend with him.  He and I both scored the gig and having the same tastes, played together in many bands over the following years, but I never did tell him that his girlfriend and I had spent a night together the previous weekend!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have found breathing exercises are a great help when facing stressful auditions. These are easily learnt - just focusing on the breath and slowing your breathing really helps focus your attention on that moment and not to fast forward your thoughts into the future where insecurity lurks sometimes. The other tip mentioned below of being in tune is also essential - check it right before you play the audition. Good luck.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been playing for 27 years and been in a few bands and played lots of gigs. I think an important part of the prep for playing in a band is to have a good chat with the guy who&#039;s contact you in the first place. Don&#039;t just text or email, pick up the phone and talk. You&#039;ll get a good feel of the vibe. I&#039;d also add that to try and enjoy yourself with the music will also help. OK, you may not get the gig, but that&#039;s not necessarily your fault, so don&#039;t take it personally. Just enjoy the music and the fact you&#039;re (hopefully) getting to play alongside some semi / professional musicians. Sometimes, your enjoyment of the music can carry you through the odd duff note. Oh, and be prepared to adapt. I&#039;ve gone to auditions / try-outs where we&#039;ve gone through the 3-4 tunes and the band enthusiastically want to get on with more. I&#039;d say listen to the unexpected songs and give it a go. That goes a long way with bands, especially originals bands or bands on tight, busy schedules. 

My last audition had the band leader - the lead guitarist / lead vocalist - giving hand signals to quieten down, leaning back to tell us to open up, pointing a finger in the air quickly to signify a song&#039;s ending, holding his pick up a little to signify he&#039;s about to get the audience involved. So, be prepared to adapt your playing on the spot and improvise if necessary. At the end of the rehearsal he said &quot;we want you to start a week on Friday, there&#039;s about 30 songs in the set and I&#039;ll throw a few others in depending on the crowd&quot;. That was about 3 months ago and we&#039;re flat out busy, fully booked into the first half of 2016. At a number of gigs, I&#039;ve played songs on the spot for the first time, so adaptability is the watch word. You can really help yourself by chatting to other band members and asking what songs may come up, etc.

Biggest fear isn&#039;t rejection or failure - don&#039;t be afraid of failure or you&#039;ll never try anything. The biggest fear of mine is disappointing people. I got my last audition on word of mouth, a text out of the blue and phone call asking me to audition. Somebody, somewhere had &#039;bigged me up&#039; as it were. So that last thing I wanted to do was a) make the an idiot out of the guy who referred me and b) give the guys that sinking feeling. So, I take pride in what I do, I prep as much as possible and I try to accommodate what a band wants as far as possible. 

Thanks for reading]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you&#039;re auditioning for a band, it&#039;s always an idea to take the opportunity to be auditioning all of them at the same time.  I&#039;ve been offered a place in a band which I refused as I could see there was always going to be some contention with one of the members.  Comments like &quot;what do you know about playing guitar you&#039;re just the bass player&quot; didn&#039;t sit well with me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was meeting with a band to play for first time as a sort-of audition although they had seen samples of my playing from my site.  I don&#039;t know what came over me but, I had just finished converting an old Yamaha BB to fretless and thought, &quot;Why not take THIS&quot;.  It actually went very well.  Playing Metheny stuff.  Played with the group for a while but, as these things go, didn&#039;t last.
Hey, speaking of auditions, how does one get &quot;in-the-network&quot; of bass players who are available for big tours?  I mean, I see these (unknown to me) players backing some pretty big players for summer tours and get on dvd&#039;s and such; how does this happen?  Is it mostly word-of-mouth and friends of friends type of thing?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great video and tips. What a pity that this didn&#039;t come few months earlier. Now I know what I did wrong on the last &quot;audition&quot; if you can call it this way ;) I had not to much auditions as I am not a professional musician, although I always wanted to be - but this is life and we cannot do to much about it? Wrong, yes we can, and I actually did something that seemed to be impossible and it was - at least for me at this stage. Ok it sounds like a mistery, but here it comes - this summer one of the most famous metal bands was searching for a touring bass player and it was quite urgent. They asked to record a video of playing one of their tunes (just the bass line without anything else). So I recorded it and sent it, but unfortunately I didn&#039;t get the job, and I know why. I was too much into it and it was so sudden so I thought that I couldn&#039;t miss the chance. And I blew it because of the rush. But I have learned something - you always should try and be proud of yourself that you did something. This led me also to review my skills and work on them stronger than ever, mainly thanks to the tips I got from SBL ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, thanks per tips! I would like to add on more suggestion: if you have more than one bass or amp (as most of bass players...) bring with you the gear you feel &quot;the main gear&quot;. I have 6 basses hanged on the wall but most of the time I use my trusted Jazz Bass, I will never bring to an audition my 5 string fretless bass which I use few time in a month. Amp: I have an Aguilar head Db751 and a small Ampeg combo. To audition i bring always the small combo cause it&#039;s easy to plug, lighter, and you&#039;ll be ready in 30 seconds... just plug 1 cable and it&#039;s done. Furthermore you&#039;ll not lost concentration on gear setting up. You shall be focus on playing! Leave pedal effects at home. Off course for the gig I bring with me the powerful Aguilar stack and all my effects :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great lesson once again Scott. Thanks! I&#039;ve been to a couple of auditions. When I got there, I behaved as if I was already in the band and we were just rehearsing. I think this helped my confidence, my relaxation, and the way the rest of the band perceived me to some extent. I don&#039;t think it was a conscious strategy, but only a thought after the fact.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great lesson thanks Scott. Ive been playing for 3 years. I&#039;ve not had audition and I&#039;ve been in 6 bands, all of which have been a disaster. The first one gave me a set list of about 30 songs and they said they knew half of them. I spent 9 months learning 15 or so to the actual recordings but it was a train crash as the other guys didn&#039;t know the songs themselves and wanted to do it their way but never said what that was. We had 2 hours practice in 9 months together.  2 bands fell through without even meeting and the last one was getting there but the drummer threw his toys out of the pram about listening to tracks on my iPad in practice when the guitarist didn&#039;t have a clue about the song structure etc. Just trying to be helpful.  Result: 6 bands and not one gig.

 I have had 3 gigs at BIMM Summer Schools in Bristol and Manchester learning 4 tracks in 4 days and performing them on stage at the end of the week. At one school I was the only bass player so I played 4 songs in 3 bands on the Fruday. 12 songs in a row and that was great :-) Got to play on stage with Steve White and had a 2 hour 1-1 lesson with Yolanda Charles. At Manchester I was the oldest at 57 and had a 10 year old Spanish guitarist who knew his part. 

 I normally make TAB sheets or notes and work out the song structure, then play it over and over to the actual recording on an ampeg scr di headphone pedal...for hours and hours until I&#039;ve nailed it. For my Trinity Grade 4 exam, I played 3 songs over 2000 times before the exam. For me it&#039;s all about repeating it till nailed. The good thing about summer school is that everyone learns their parts to the actual recording.

The thing which freaks me out about bands is, as you say, a ridiculous ask to know a long set list. I&#039;m having a break and uploading my bass playing to actual tracks on utube and I&#039;ve got over 110 videos up under my channel UKFlamesey. It&#039;s a sort of portfolio I can refer people to and might help or avoid an audition lol. No issues with the other band members not knowing their parts! It&#039;s fun being part of the Beatles or whatever.

I&#039;m thinking of doing 2 weeks summer school with Berklee Valencia next year but I know deep down I need to find a good band to improve. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The best prep for an audition is to play. Practice the song/s inside out. I&#039;ve found there is no substitute for that. Oh, and try to get some sleep. And one more thought, if you are going to an audition, the band is looking for someone like you, be that guy.  My biggest fear in going to my first audition was that I would screw up.

		<description><![CDATA[Good tips. I would add one. Make sure you are in tune. Have a tuner with you or be very comfortable tuning by ear. You may learn a tune in standard tuning and when you get to the audition, the band tunes a 1/2 step down. I have seen many people who can&#039;t tune or think close is good enough.]]></description>

By the time I got to my audition I had ruined my dress shirt and my hair was soaking wet. Needless to say the rest of the audition didn&#039;t go well, I was shaking the entire time.]]></description>
