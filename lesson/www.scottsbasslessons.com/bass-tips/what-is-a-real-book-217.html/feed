		<description><![CDATA[Just as a point of clarification, The Real Book published by Hal Leonard.  There&#039;s a Vol 2, Latin, Rock, Blues, and Christmas versions as well.  The NEW Real Book is published by Sher Music and has completely different charts.  I have both, as well as the Latin Real Book (which has some BEASTLY charts) and the Latin Real Easy Book (which is a deceptive title), which are also from Sher Music.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love iReal Book, partly for play along but also transposition, and the play along also has a mixer and can change the lead voice (guitar, organ etc.).  My only reservation is limited playlist - they rely on users to submit charts, lots of standards and pop but not everything!  for some reason they are strong on Brazilian tunes, which I love.  It&#039;s also not a big pile of paper to lug around...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I got the New Real Book about a week ago from Amazon.  Don&#039;t know the first thing about jazz, got it mainly as fodder for walking and continuous arpeggio exercises. The deciding factor for me was that it&#039;s spiral bound.  Some of the others are bound with a plastic comb, I don&#039;t have the patience for that.  (Patience is not always a virtue.)]]></description>
