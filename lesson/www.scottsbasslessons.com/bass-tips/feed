				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Usually in my lessons I tell what you 'should' be doing to get your bass playing to the next level...</p>
<p>So, I thought it'd be fun for this lesson to switch that around and to tell you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what NOT to do</span>.</p>
<p><strong>In this lesson I discuss:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Why knowing your <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/play-multiple-octave-scales-like-bad-ass.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scales and arpeggios</a> will NOT make you a better soloist</li>
<li>The simple things you could be doing to make you <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/outlining-the-changes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a better soloist</a> - but you're probably not</li>
<li>What you <em>really</em> NEED to know about <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/developing-your-vocabulary-with-the-blues-scale.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the blues scale</a> (we've ALL been guilty of this)</li>
<li>And, much more</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm going to share the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">top 10 bass soloing MISTAKES</span> that SO many bass players are making... in fact, it's very likley that you're already making some of these mistakes - I know I've made them all!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>Have you ever watched video after video on YouTube of bass players tearing up and down the fingerboard at a gazzilion miles an hour, improvising with ease over any chord sequence…</p>
<p>And meanwhile, you’ve been left feeling slightly bummed out, and in some cases wondering if there’s any point in you even carrying on with your bass playing as you don’t think you’ll ever reach that level… not even if you lived for 1000 years.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Well here’s the gag… In this bass lesson I’m actually NOT going to tell you that “if you keep practicing you’ll be blazing up and down the fingerboard in no time”…</p>
<p>But, what I <em>am</em> going to tell you is that it DOESN’T matter… not one bit.</p>
<p>Instead you’re going to learn the 5 things you MUST have to become a great bass player and musician…</p>
<p>And blazing fast technique is NOT one of them.</p>
<p>I’ve also got a super special guest in this video with me. One of the funkiest bass players on the planet.</p>
<p>You know <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/quick-lick/michael-league-quick-lick.html" target="_blank">Michael League</a> from Snarky Puppy, right? Well, when Michael isn’t playing bass - he get’s this guy to play bass for him. Nuff said. ;)</p>
<p>And remember, I’d love to hear back from you guys… have you ever felt down about your playing after watching a video of someone else on YouTube? Has it ever got so bad it’s almost made you quit bass? Share your story in the comments under the video.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<p>In this video I’m going to show you a new effects pedal I’ve just bought that’s been blowing my mind…</p>
<p>I’ve been having so much fun using it within my practice time that I wanted to show you how I’ve been using it - and more importantly WHY I’ve been using it.</p>
<p>I should also say, I’m totally un-affiliated with the company who make this pedal… so there’s no weird motives for me to make this video… the pedal’s just been rocking my world so much I wanted to share it with you guys :)</p>
<p>As always, I’d love to hear from you too… What pedals are rocking your world at the moment?! Lemme know what and why in the comments below the video…</p>
<p>See you in the shed…</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>So… long story short, I ended up in hospital. Boo!</p>
<p>Nothing too serious, (I tell you all about it the video)… but while I was there I thought it’d be fun to film a brand new lesson for you focusing on how and why transcribing is SO important… showing you my own personal transcribing process… plus, exactly how long it takes me.</p>
<p>And yes, I had my bass with me in hospital…</p>
<p>The groove never stops! ;)</p>
<p>As always… lemme know your thoughts on transcribing in the comments underneath the video! Is it something you do regularly? Is it something you enjoy? Do you find it hard or frustrating? Lemme know!</p>
<p>See you in the shed,</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. In the new lesson you’re also going to see me playing a cool semi acoustic bass from the guys over at Alpha Instruments, plus we’re discussing the whole rosewood export ban and it’s implications on luthiers around the world and travelling musicians.</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>One question that comes up over and over is…</p>
<p><strong><em>“what should I upgrade first… my bass or my amp”?</em></strong></p>
<p>I have a really strong opinion on this topic - so if you’ve ever wondered what and exactly why you should be choosing one over the other… this video.</p>
<p>In this video I’ve also got the amazing <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/damian-erskine" target="_blank">Damian Erskine</a> with me.</p>
<p>He’s been in the studio with us recording a brand new course for the membership here at ScottsBassLessons focusing on his amazing plucking hand technique… if you’re a member, keep a look out!</p>
<p>You can see him in action using his unique plucking hand approach in this video + we also get to check out the custom made pickup ramp he has fitted to his bass where both pickups are moulded into one single piece of resin… it’s hard to explain in text, but you can check it out in the new video.</p>
<p>Bass vs amp, how to play chords on bass, the 3 finger technique… it’s all in there.</p>
<p>As always, I’d LOVE to hear back from you guys… when it was time to upgrade your gear, what did you decide to go for… bass or amp… and why? Make sure you jump into the conversation in the comments!</p>
<p>See you in the shed,</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. HUGE thanks for all the amazing feedback about the new course we released into the ScottsBassLessons.com membership last week - “<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/courses/slap-bass-fundamentals-phil-mann" target="_blank">Slap Bass Fundamentals</a>” with Phil Mann</p>
<p>From the feedback we’ve received over the last few weeks you guys have been LOVING it!</p>

<p>Ok… let’s talk … SLAP BASS! ;)</p>
<p>I’ve just released a brand new video where I’m going to show you 4 cool slap hacks that really helped me get my slap bass chops together…</p>
<p>I’m talking about arm rotation, positioning, fretting hand percussive strikes (mastering these are super helpful!)… and a crazy fast triplet pattern I do - it’s a heap of fun!</p>
<p>Ooo… and we’ve also got the phenomenal bassist <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/rufus-philpot" target="_blank">Rufus Philpot</a> with us in the studio recording a brand new course for SBL… in this video you’re going to see what’s going on behind the scenes + Rufus gives us run down of his brand new Moollon jazz bass… it’s orange… my favourite colour!</p>
<p>I love to hear from you guys in the comments… so let me know what’s been your biggest challenge with getting your own slap bass technique together…</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. If you’re a member over at <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/" target="_blank">ScottBassLessons.com</a> we’ve also just released a brand new course into our course library…</p>
<p>Introducing “<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/courses/slap-bass-fundamentals-phil-mann" target="_blank">Slap Bass Fundamentals</a>” with SBL’s very own Phil Mann.</p>
<p>This course has been specifically created for beginner and intermediate bass players who want to get started with slap bass - but also expands into styles that were popularised by players such as Larry Graham and Louis Johnson.</p>
<p>In short, there’s over 2 hours of jam packed footage - it’s step by step - and you’re going to LOVE it!</p>
<p>It’s out NOW… so if you’re a member you can login and get started today, and if you’re not a member yet you can <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/" target="_blank">grab your 14 day free trial here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Jazz bass vs Precision bass thing is a question that comes up regularly simply from the fact that they are two of the longest standing bass guitar designs there are.</p>
<p>The gag is... when you look into it, the sound of these instruments are actually very different... so for me there is an underlying question of, should there even be a J bass vs P bass thing?</p>
<p>Check out the video... lemme know your thoughts in the comments!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

<p>So, while I sit here writing this post I'm sat in a studio in Bushwick, Brooklyn working with some of the coolest and most respected bass players on the planet...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncgiCAyW1-Q" target="_blank">Cody Wright</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by--gYW3K2A" target="_blank">Rufus Philpot</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIy5cv93dCc" target="_blank">Damian Erskine</a> have already been in to record their new courses for SBL and next up is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQjYOR40RU" target="_blank">Steve Jenkins</a>, and following him will be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_F5I5g8siFo" target="_blank">Rich Brown</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEYB0p0W4Yk" target="_blank">Jonathan Maron</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3YZTFv3ipY" target="_blank">Evan Marian</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpaVOJPtgyA" target="_blank">Adam Neely</a>.</p>
<p>Mind. Blown.</p>
<p>Anyhow...</p>
<p>Last night I was doing a Q&amp;A session for the video you're about to watch, and one of the questions was from a guy who for one reason or another can't go to music school.</p>
<p>The reality is that SO many aspiring bassists are in the exact same situation.</p>
<p>They need to support their family. There's no school in the area where they live. They don't have the grades to get in. They don't have the cash to be able to afford it. There's a heap of different reasons why someone might not be able to go.</p>
<p>That gag is, going to music school is not "the answer"...</p>
<p>In this video I discuss why in certain cases going to music school is the WRONG thing to do.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>I’ve been playing bass now for around 20 years, which has been long enough for me to hear about every bizarre myth there is when it comes to learning the bass…</p>
<p>I thought it’d be fun to film a quick video for you focusing on some of the most common ones… in fact, my top 5!</p>
<p>The unfortunate thing is that these common myths can actually do damage to your progression as a bassist as they can make you doubt yourself, or simply throw you off the right track. Hopefully this video will help you focus on what’s actually important - hard work, practice, keeping inspired, and enjoying every minute of it.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. And for giggles… here are my top 5 myths that are NOT related to bass playing… <b>(for the bass version watch the video!)</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Humans use only 10% of their brains</li>
<li>Thomas Edison invented the lightbulb</li>
<li>There is no gravity in space</li>
<li>If you shave your hair, it returns thicker and faster (are you kidding me, lol!)</li>
<li>The great wall of China is the only man-made structure visible from space</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway… enough of those shenanigans… check out the video for the top 5 myths about learning bass!</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>This lesson is taken from the new course we've just released by the amazingly talented Steve Lawson.</p>
<p>Steve is going to show you how to break free from the stereotypical looping techniques you may have seen or used in the past, and instead start with a melody first - and then create bass lines, chords and textures underneath the melody... essentially flipping how you'd normally use a looper on its head!</p>
<p>I've never seen this kind of technique used with a looper so I've shedding it all week myself, lol.</p>
<p>Steve's new course (which the above lesson has been taken from) is called "Looping Essentials for Bassists" and includes everything you'll ever need to know about looping...</p>
<p><strong>In the course you learn:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exactly what a looper is and how to get started</li>
<li>How to perform with textures and create pads using your looper</li>
<li>How to use your looper as a practice and composition development tool</li>
<li>Specific rhythmic exercises to help you get your looping fundamentals together</li>
<li>How to harmonise your melodies</li>
<li>How to effectively layer your loops and the many different approaches you can take</li>
<li>How to apply chords within your looping patterns and the different combinations you can use</li>
<li>How to break up the rhythms within your loops to make your compositions much more interesting</li>
<li>How to effectively build your library of looping vocabulary</li>
<li>And WAY more...</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're already a member of the Academy at Scott's Bass Lessons you can simply login and access the full course today to get started. But, if you're not a member yet, you can just <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy" target="_blank">go here and grab your free 14 day trial.</a></p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott:)</p>
<p>PS. As you may have heard (as there's a LOT of excitement about it already)... next month we're going to be embarking on one the most exciting projects we've ever put together...</p>
<p>In February the team here at SBL will be filming a whole set of new courses for the membership at Scott's Bass Lessons... we're going to be working with some of the best bass players on the planet, such as Steve Jenkins, Rufus Philpot, Jonathan Maron, Cody Wright, Damian Erskine, Rich Brown and Evan Marien.</p>
<p>Insane, right?!</p>
<p>Although SBL is already the world's ultimate online bass school... this year we're taking it to another level...</p>
<p>2017 is going to be a good year! ;)</p>

<p>Figuring out where the notes on the fingerboard are is pretty easy... open google, search "notes on bass fingerboard", click "images" and there you'll have a <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=notes+on+bass+fretboard&amp;biw=1433&amp;bih=771&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-5MiWzcvRAhWBWxoKHR2nD5AQ_AUIBigB" target="_blank">gazzilion diagrams</a> all showing you where the notes are...</p>
<p>BUT - the real work comes when you start to try and memorise the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/beginners/learn-notes-bass-guitar-l197.html">notes on the fingerboard</a>. That's the tricky bit!</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to show you a super easy to understand exercise that's going to help you memorise all the notes over the entire fingerboard in an easy to manage systematic way.</p>
<p>Ready? Let's do this!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
