when you say to play out of the line with bass, does it mean to play third, fifth and seventh and chromatic.
thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great lesson as always, Scott. I never realised how much &quot;Bitching&quot; goes on, or is that called these days expressing one&#039;s views. Every one is entitled to their opinions , but come on GIRLS, we can always take something from the lesson.

		<description><![CDATA[We should all read with care.  I made no mention of walking. 

I am suggesting schemes by which the bassist can be faithful to the harmonic intent while completely or partially avoiding R and 5 while maintaining the 2 feel.  In the process, more interesting and more melodic lines are possible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[B. S.   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The greats play melodically.  They only restrict themselves to primarily roots and fifths when the chording instrument is prone to reharmonize.  They NEVER total restrict themselves to roots and fifths.

Also, just because you are not restricted to R-5 does not mean you have to play more notes; for example, instead of playing R-5, you can play 3-7; the same number of notes.  Instead of playing R, play 3. Sometimes you ignore the chord and play pickup figures like b7-7-R, even against a M7 chord.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is NO rule, nor theory that demands that 3rds, 7th, suspensions in the bass line are not supportive of the song.  In fact, using them allows for a counter melody in the bass.  That&#039;s where all the famous and memorable signature bass lines come from.  Further, in fact, original material offers greater opportunity for creativity, because there are no preexisting expectations on the part of the listener.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gary As a long time bassist. I understand what you are saying but what Scotts about is teaching the fundamentals and in turn being creative. As far as being basic I&#039;ve seen many bass players in simple bands just playing from the 5th fret up and not utilizing the low notes. Scotts stuff is like a trainer getting  an athelete ready! As an older player can I use a trainer? heck yeah.There is foundation in those lower notes but as far as chord tones. I find great joy in using these and creating a simple supportive line but with a twist. Listen to Jack Casady as an example of creating a simple line with chord tones.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here is a different perspective... The role of the bass player (and everyone in the band) is to selflessly support the song. It&#039;s about making music as a band, not showing off your chops, theory skills, or not getting bored playing root notes. 30+ years of working with bands in the studio, helping them craft their arrangements and parts has taught me that simpler can many times be better.

Perhaps my opinion is somewhat genre specific as I play in a band that plays simple, roots-rock / Americana type songs. Any chord other than a major or minor is rare. Plus, the chords change so fast there isn&#039;t time to noodle around with chord tones. The material is all original, so I have to create my bass parts from scratch. 

Think of Ed Freeland&#039;s role in the Mavericks that he has discussed. It would be wildly inappropriate for me to play stuff like Scott does in this lesson on almost any song in our catalog (however I wish I COULD play like that). The focus is on the vocals/harmonies. EVERYTHING else is there to support the vocals. There is little room to play anything more than rhythmic root notes with simple runs to lead verses into choruses, etc without stepping on the vocals or the lead guitar player. 

I like Scott&#039;s lessons, but find much it doesn&#039;t really apply to my band and style of music I play. Doesn&#039;t stop me from wanting to be a better musician and expanding my skills, but the lessons have a real jazz bent IMO which is something that just doesn&#039;t transfer easily to my role in this band.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is superb advice for some kinds of music, but don&#039;t try it for mainstream jazz. For jazz accompaniment, playing in 2 through the head and then &quot;walking&quot; in 4 on the solos is what most leaders want. Some jazz pianists and guitarists will get up and choke you for playing so many notes and rhythms because your rhythms will conflict with theirs.]]></description>
