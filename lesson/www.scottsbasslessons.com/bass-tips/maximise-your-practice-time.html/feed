		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Scott! My mind was thinking that I was concentrating too narrowly, but somehow &quot;felt&quot; that I should master C Major before moving on. Can we have a list of Arpeggios and suggested songs in different keys in the Academy or a link to a site that lists these. Thanks again Scott!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great stuff. Made me think what a piano player told me in the past about learning jazz standards . Instead of aiming for learning 4 or 5 tunes this month, he said, learn 1 tune in at least 4 or 5 different keys. You&#039;ll absord this 1 song really thouroughly and you&#039;ll find you&#039;ll learn new songs a lot quicker and do treat them the same way. Transposing becomes a second nature that way and the progress you make is amazing. As a matter of fact: if you transpose a tune to a few different keys,  you are allready learning other tunes at least partially. This really benefits progress! ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, Great comment to open with about the noise in our daily lives! It is for that reason I do not participate in social media. I do subscribe to things that come into my inbox that I value. Obviously SBL made that cut for my time. Life is truly all about time in so many ways, it is a completely finite resource and to top it off not one of us knows how much we have to spend. Consider Prince yesterday, I seriously doubt he woke up thinking today is checkout. My musicianship is very important to me and for that reason I invest time in it and you are a part of that time investment. Good job! Thanks!]]></description>
