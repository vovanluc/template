 I rely on my Upcart to get my gear from here to there. Handles stairs beautifully. The whole thing folds up and takes little space. Saves my shoulders.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Batteries, a batt-o-meter and more batteries. I&#039;ve always left my bass plugged into the amp at home so it&#039;s ready when I want to practice. 15 years ago, I got a new bass. This was the first time I had active pickups and I didn&#039;t know much about they worked. When I was at a rehearsal a week down the track, and found the battery was flat, I learnt that as long as the bass is plugged in, it is using the battery. Fortunately, I had a tuner that used the same battery.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An extension cord is always good to have, 6 feet or 2 meters.  I have gone to one or two shows where an extension cord was needed but the facility had none to lend out.



Most embarrassing moment was with a tool called OnSong.  This tool is used on an IPad and replaces paper copies of your music.  For the most part, it is a great tool.  However, at one point during our set before the start of one particular song, the software decided to change the key of the music.  So, the band started to play in the key of G and I started in a completely different note.  Needless to say, the song was a mess and I only played through the chorus of the song as I had that part memorized.  


Conclusion: I no longer use the software...paper is always good!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott, I always carry some Vocalzone tablets with me as they really help me prepare to sing backing vocals. They can also help you to become best pals with the lead singer, who will cadge some Vocalzones from you when he/she has forgotten to bring any! Another small &#039;out there&#039; item that is easy to carry in the bag is a drum key, which will endear you to the the drummer when he/she loses their own.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I also have cycle bottles (usually 2) with water and water plus energy powder. The great advantages of cycle bottles is that they don&#039;t generally spill if knocked over, they are easy to grab, take a quick swig. It&#039;s cheaper than buying bottled water. 

Also I have a Line6 Sonic Port and loaded up iPhone/iPad with JamUp with some nice bass rigs, so if the rig fails then I can in an emergency resort to using that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A stand is VERY important! I had a gig last year where i had a fretted and fretless bass, and i used a really bad stand that was at the gig. Halfway through a song were i was using the fretless, the stand broke and my bass fell to the floor damaging o electronics. After a few minutes of try to get the bass to work, we gave up and i had to play the rest of the gig with the fretless, which for some of the songs, was extremely challenging.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A bottle of water! Most refreshing in the middle of gigs.

One disaster I made was forgetting the bass! We had a rehearsel just before the show in the place we are giging, all things on place, then we had a break before the show with time for change clothing and eating. I lived a couple of hundred meters from the gig and took my bass with me home and got some food and then put stageclothes on and went back to the show, sat down and waited, we played after another artist. The other artist is beginning to end her show and we start to prepare to enter the scene - AAAAAHHHH! Where is my bass!!?? Suddenly I realize I forgot it at home! I had to run like a maniac to get the bass at home! Did return right before entering the stage, heartbeat around 280. Its NOT a pleasent feeling!]]></description>

I also bring a set of acoustic and electric guitar strings, picks and a capo. Those should be the guitarist&#039;s responsibility, but I&#039;ve been stuck in awkward situations because they forgot something.]]></description>
