		<description><![CDATA[I Loved that video, really.! I have a huge library of books about music, theory, exercises. I really love to have them. While I was watching your video, I opened another Tab in my browser and bought the &quot;Effortless Mastery: Liberating the Musician Within&quot;, it seems to be a very good Book, I can&#039;t wait for read it. One book that I recommend it the &quot;The Music Lesson: A Spiritual Search for Growth Through Music&quot; by Victor Wooten. It&#039;s NOT a book of exercises or Music Theory, but it&#039;s an amazing book for a musician to read, I really love that book.!
Thank you..!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks as ever Scott.  I will certainly have a look at Werner as I&#039;m into NLP and self-development.  Once again I recommend The Music Lesson by the great man Victor Wooten which is more a philosophy book, and not just for bass players!]]></description>
