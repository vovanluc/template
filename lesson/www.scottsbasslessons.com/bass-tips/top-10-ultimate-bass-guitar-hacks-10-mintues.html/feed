		<description><![CDATA[1) I got the strap locks from the swing-top of my beer bottle. They are red and I love red.
2) I can&#039;t forget my bass stand. I moved the strap holder 12 cm away from the middle position at the end of the body; and instead I mounted 2 rubber feet (right expression?) 6 cm left and right away from the middle position. My bass never has tumbled over. And I think that the bass is hanging more stable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My hacks:

Use superglue on your fingertips when your calluses peel or blister.

Keeping the groove and staying in the pocket is more important than playing more notes. Less is always more.

Learn how to tune by ear using harmonics

The bass drum is your twin. Lock in with the bass drum.

Always have extras. Power cords, extension cord, power strip, battery tuner, patch cables, etc. You never know what will go wrong. 

Befriend and trust the sound guy. ]]></description>
