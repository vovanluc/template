		<description><![CDATA[Having built a number of both my personal favorite is a P body(alder) Jazz neck(rosewood) and P / J pickups. I love the sound of a P w/ swamp ash body maple neck amazing clarity but a bit to brite and cutting for 60-70 rock, where I prefer the darker &quot;Browner&quot; sound. I just can&#039;t quite connect to a straight Jazz, they&#039;re great, just not my sound (Think John Paul Jones The Lemon Song).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott. Check out Monk Montgomery playing Bock to Bock: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGkXUCDOV9I Monk was one of the early Jazz Bass players. The tone is smooth and round. Stings are obviously damped with the rubber under the bridge cover. You would not play slap bass with this set up. Surely its not so much the bass, J or P, as the set up and how you play it? I play Jazz basses with different set ups. My worker-day bass has an adjustable damper so I can play smooth jazz or slap as required. Thanks for the inspiration. J]]></description>
