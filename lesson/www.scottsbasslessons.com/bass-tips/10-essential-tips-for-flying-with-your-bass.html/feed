		<description><![CDATA[Great tips--thanks!  Agree with others about the upside-down gig bag, especially.  I recently got a Hiscox flight case when I purchased a bass on a recent trip to London, so that I could fly home with it. It&#039;s a great case, and the salesperson even stood on it to show me how strong it was.  The contoured profile is especially good for carrying on, compared with the big rectangular hardshell cases.  Fortunately, I was allowed to stow it in the coat closet during the flight.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In addition, it is important to say that I never had any problem with the crew members or the air company, they are always very kind! The problem I had was with the airport crew! The lady was very unpolite and rude, she didn&#039;t even want to talk or &quot;hear my story&quot;, and this was before entering the boarding room, before passing the x-ray. You have no idea how much strugle I had. When I finally arrived at Sao Paulo, the captain saw me picking my guitar and told: &quot;hey, you can&#039;t take this guitar with you...&quot; I panic!!! Then he continued &quot;You didn&#039;t play any music for us!&quot; If he knew the trouble I had, he wouldn&#039;t make this joke, LOL.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome tips, Scott!   Here&#039;s one more:  Here in the US, you can buy a case with TSA locks on it so that the security guy&#039;s master key will open it.  I bought my son a guitar case with TSA-approved locks, and he&#039;s had no problems flying to Ireland.  Similar experience for a friend who had to fly with his keyboads.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very nice tip for wearing the gig bag upside down. I will try to use this tip next tipe.
I personally don&#039;t like to check in my bass or acoustic guitar, so I always try to take with me on the plane, and when I do, I always leave on the closet they have near the cabin, where they also put strollers and other big stuff. 
It always worked well until the last when I was flying from Miami to Sao Paulo...
I was with my acoustic guitar on a hardshell case and the lady on the x-ray told me that I should check-in my guitar. I won&#039;t tell all my strugle that went through Blood, Sweat and Tears (who knows that band, lol), but in the end I was able to take it with me...
So my suggestion is, if you want to take your bass with you, don&#039;t put it on a hardshell case! Always go with the Gig Bag!
One more time, thanks Scott for the awesome tips!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A good idea also is to give a call prior to the flight to check if you can take your bass on board on this specific flight.

I agree also the best advise is definitely to be kind while explaining your story during check-in. As a musician, taking care of you instrument, you should have a positive image and the crew members are generally helpful.

I remember when I bring back my Noguera from France to Shanghai, I explained how much I care about this instrument to the first attendant I met at the gate of frequent flyer check-in. It was an Air France A380, the crew told me that it should be no problem, they radio the whole team from security check to boarding gate to inform them that a guy with an oversize case was willing to board and was coming... They couldn&#039;t confirm it was possible until the on-board crew reach the plane. I walked through the airport with the risk to finally gate check... They were all super kind, welcoming me at each step with a big smile and a &quot;hey, you&#039;re the guy with a bass?&quot;. The on-board crew finally confirmed it was ok. On board, they put it in the crew coat cabinet, the flight attendant was again super kind, showing me the place and how safe was the case... My hardcase is the standard Fender one, no way for the overhead lockers in the second deck of A380...

As a conclusion, it&#039;s worth to try but as mentioned by Stuart, get ready to fail and finally check your case...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good tips! I have not flown with my bass nearly as much as you, and I have not flown internationally with a bass. Only in the U.S.. But, I have a few comments:

- Priority boarding is not just a good tip. It is KEY! Do what you have to do to get it! Overhead bins and the coat closet are first come, first served. If the coat closet and overheads are full by the time you board, you will be forced to gate check your instrument. And sometimes, the flight attendants fill the coat closet with their stuff before the first passenger even comes aboard. As a last resort, when they call for boarding for people with babies or handicaps, ask very nicely if you can board then as well because of your &quot;special needs&quot; to stow your instrument.

- No matter what the law says, there is a loophole and the gate agent always has discretionary power to make you put your bass in the hold. Thus, it is always (ALWAYS! Period. No matter what) a possibility that you will have to gate check your bass. Thus, I never fly with my bass in a gig bag. I always put it in a hardshell case, in case it has to be gate checked. This is also why you should always be very nice and polite to the gate agent and the flight attendants. Any one of them has the power to make you gate check your bass - within the law. So, being rude, ordering them around, and quoting the law is not likely to help you at all. Be honey, not vinegar.

- Don&#039;t just put duct tape (or similar) around the case. Specifically, put it around the case so that it covers every latch. You&#039;re not just trying to make sure the case doesn&#039;t come open. You are also making sure the latches don&#039;t pop open where they are sticking out and can get caught on something and ripped off. What are you going to do with a case that didn&#039;t come open but has all the latches ripped off? Tape it shut every time you put your bass in it? I do leave the handle untaped to make it easier for the baggage handlers (and myself) to not just pick it up by an end and toss it.

- A bass in a hardshell case will fit in some overhead bins. I&#039;ve done that. It will definitely fit in the flight attendants&#039; coat closet. But that is only if the plane is big enough to have overheads that large and have a coat closet. Some smaller planes have tiny overheads and no coat closet. In which case, you will be forced to gate check it. Thus why to always use a hard case, not a gig bag.]]></description>
