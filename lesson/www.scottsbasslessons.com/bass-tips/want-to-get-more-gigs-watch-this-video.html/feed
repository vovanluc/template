		<description><![CDATA[A very good advice, I&#039;ve recently been in a situation where I needed exactly to play a jam in tumbao style and had to learn it on-the-fly. It would have been so much easier if I&#039;d actually listened to it before (as I did right after).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot for all of your vdeos, Scott! They&#039;ve really helped me with my playing, but most important, they&#039;ve really helped me re-falling in love with the instrument and with the habit of learning and practicing the theory behind it, as I was tired and bored of other courses that were not so interesting as yours. 
There&#039;s something about the way you teach that makes me stick to the chair til&#039; the end of every video. 
Congrats! You are doing an amazing job and I appreciate it pal.

Ps: Nevermind my crappy English :p

Regards from Argentina! (Y)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott! Those are 3 great tips :)
Last week a band where I&#039;m playing Funk ask me to play some Mark Anthony&#039;s stuff and I was like &quot;oh god, I don&#039;t even know how to play salsa!&quot;, so I decided to go ask for help from a friend of mine who&#039;s a cuban panist and he saved me! :D Since then i&#039;ve been listening to a lot of latin and salsa musicians, and now I have a &quot;new tool&quot; to get more gigs :)

So... it works! a lot!

Cheers from Mexico! ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great tips as per usual! 
I&#039;ve found immersion to be the most powerful here, letting a good groove sink in subtly over time is less stressful and feels more natural to jam on after.
Knowing what I&#039;m playing really does give me that extra confidence as well, and transcriptions have been massively helpful with that. 
One extra thing that I find useful is being able to explain something clearly, once I can do that I know that I know it properly. Your lessons are a really great example of this, keep up the good groove!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great video Scott - thanks for that. Just came back from an audition with a rockabilly / motown / 60&#039;s band (fingers crossed) and in order to get into the mood / vibe I did exactly what you said in the 3rd tip - immersed myself in the music. When you know and feel the music you are playing then you can play it better - and share the groove. Something I learnt from Victor Wooten is that music isn&#039;t only about the notes - that&#039;s one of only 10 important things. If you got the groove, the feel, the tone - then you can play a few wrong notes - but at the RIGHT time and the RIGHT feel - then they ARE The right notes.  So - don&#039;t just focus on getting the notes right, remember there are 9 other things JUST as important!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott.  Good advice, that we do need to hear.  It finally dawned on me to put the kind of music I want to play or need to learn on my Ipod for my work commute.  Two things:  Recently I had to learn the line for Joe Jackson&#039;s Sunday Papers.  And in the old days I&#039;d hit pause and remind on the tape or cd player, or even you tube.  But I found Sheet Music Direct for two dollars laid out the part, a printable lead sheet and a play along feature with an adjustable tempo.  The song has got lots of subtlies I couldn&#039;t hear, so when you talk about transcribing the songs we have to learn, this site  and there may be others like it, helped me enormously.  And regarding practicing, (may be slightly off topic but connected), can you describe the way you&#039;ve set up your workstation?  We could all benefit from having a more organized: computer, drum tracks, recording possibility, situation, and I&#039;m just thinking either here or elsewhere you could take the camera back to your work area and show us what you&#039;re using and why.
As always, thanks so much for the knowledge and steady inspiration.
