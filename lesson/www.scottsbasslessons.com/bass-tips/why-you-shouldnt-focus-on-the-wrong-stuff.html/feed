		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott and congratulations on your many successes.  We spoke briefly at the Warwick Music Hall bar on the Saturday night.  You mentioned that your Dad was visiting my home town of Perth, Western Australia.  I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll make Bass Camp 2016, but maybe we can catch up in 2017.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Invaluable advice Scott.  I recently spent seven days at the Warwick Bass Camp and played a different brand &#038; model of bass every morning, afternoon &#038; evening (where else can you do that?). Whether the basses cost $1,500 or $10,000 the tone, after I fiddled with the knobs, sounded pretty much the same.  The difference that was really noticeable was how they felt in my hands, and the more comfortable I was, the better I played:-)  I had thought of buying a new bass whilst I was away, but realised that the bass I liked the best I already owned!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Francois, yeah Nik loves Scofield, lol! I had the same thing with the P bass... I started playing them around 2 years ago, and my relationship with the sound and feel of those instruments has totally changed the way I play and the way I want to sound - super interesting stuff! Man, I LOVE BASS! ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey guys, great questions - so we were just using the regular blues chord sequence as a framework, and then everything else it totally improvised within that, much like creating a picture on a canvas. We&#039;re listening to each other, feeding off each other lines and phrases, and just trying to make it feel good. @diegomuino:disqus - It also helps that Dave (the drummer) is really holding it together as it means i can be a lot more rhythmically free and the band won;t lose the groove if that makes sense. Groove on guys! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very good advice indeed, and cool performance.  Besides all the obvious rhythm section greatness going on, I also dig the somewhat &quot;John Scofield-esque&quot; phrasing and telecaster tone of your guitar player!  Excellent playing all-around.  I also agree that a new instrument can inspire you.  I recently purchased a 4-string, passive p-bass after playing an active, dual humbucker 5-string bass exclusively for the last 15 years.  It has taken my playing in new interesting directions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree 100 percent with Scott. Too much attention is paid on gear when you should be focusing on the theory. I have gotten to a point where I just use what works for me I do pay attention to what others use but I take that with a grain of salt since most of the time what others use doesn&#039;t actually work for me. Great video Scott. ]]></description>
