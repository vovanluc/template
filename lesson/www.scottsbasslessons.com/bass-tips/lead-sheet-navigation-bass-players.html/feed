		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Scott.  Most of my playing is from fully written-out bass parts and I use (your) steps 1, 2, 4, and then, if I have the time; 3.  But when I&#039;m playing in smaller combos, reading from fake books, I use (your) steps 1, 2, 3 &#038; 4 (the melodic players/singers don&#039;t always follow the written form, but it helps to have looked at where the Head, verses, choruses, bridge etc. start and end.  Thanks again for another useful lesson.  And if I may suggest - Stefan, Trebor, Robert, don&#039;t get too hung up on whether the Cm7 is or isn&#039;t a III, just follow Scott&#039;s steps to make your reading easier.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you listen to the chord progression, you&#039;ll find that the pitch center in line 3 (ignoring the intro) is Eb, not Ab.  Yes, c-7 is a iii chord in the key of Ab but, in this case, measures 1-5 and 9-13 (again, ignoring the intro) echo each other: vi ii V7 I IV in Ab, then the same pattern in Eb.  Soloing over each segment can be approached similarly, with the first statement in Ab and the second in Eb.]]></description>
