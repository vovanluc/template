		<description><![CDATA[Very very informative Scott. As I’m becoming busier by the day with remote session recordings and it helps to see someone laying down the ground rules for you as opposed to having to figure everything out by yourself.

I just wonder how many producers provide you with a chord chart or at least a road map for the song structure? By far I was able to convince most of the producers I’ve worked with to send me a chord chart along with every project. To me it is super essential.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Brilliant video. wish I saw this 12 months ago. Last year I was asked to lay a bass track for a friend&#039;s solo album. I was given the track with guitar, drums and vocals only and i added the bass. (I was given carte blanche as to how to play the bass which was cool) also cool was that I played the bass track in Adelaide, Australia and the Drum track was done by Gregg Bisonette ( David Lee Roth &#038; Ringo Starr&#039;s drummer) at his studio in L.A. So technology has given me the opportunity to record a track with one of the world&#039;s most renown rock drummers.... what a trip! Couldn&#039;t do THAT in the 80&#039;s.  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice one Scott - looking forward to the forthcoming videos - I&#039;ve had to figure this all out for myself over the years so its great to have it all in one place as a reference for people new to it! Be nice to know what DI boxes your favour (recording and live)?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[well, i do listen and check it out by ear too, the lines start bumping up in my head and I&#039;m trying to nail them asap. It&#039;s great ear training at the same time, and, in my case, it keeps my approach really fresh. For lots of chord changes and a really difficult structure a chart might be handy of course. But combining it with your study makes the benefit is greater :-). You&#039;ve at least trained your ears a bit again. And, it&#039;ll go faster and faster? When I played in Cover bands I always learned the songs by heart without charts, even before the first rehearsal. I still know &#039;m after all these years.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, I am using exactly the same approach since 1 year. My bandmats love this kind of structured teardown of songs they want&#039;t to cover and/or practice. 
I swear we saved soo much time and confusion with  this setup. It  speeds up rehearsal and workout  of  parts where no one has any guess what is going on. 

Reconstucting a missing timesignature and tempo is the harderst and the most time consuming part for me,
but it&#039;s worth to take the time for this step even when there are tempo-changes or signature-changes.
The benefit of this analysis is that you get familiar with the song and while doing this I automatically memorize the guts.]]></description>
