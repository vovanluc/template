		<description><![CDATA[Amen, brother.  I go through the bass course and then I hop over to the blues course and then to the walking bass course and then the bass line creating course and then...

You get the idea.  Sometimes I just say forget it and sit there playing scales and arpeggios to clear my head.  Maybe I&#039;ll finish that beginner&#039;s course one day...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really liked your &#039;next shiny object&#039; analogy: it is so true, as I found when learning saxophone. There is no substitute for a good grounding in the fundamentals.

		<description><![CDATA[As a newbie academy member (and an older &#039;beginner&#039;) I found this lesson to be so true. It is so tempting to get caught up in all the neat things out there instead of sticking with basics. I am actually playing bass now in church group and its the basics I really need to master first, as I am learning. Great job, Scott.

		<description><![CDATA[Such a great point, Scott, and one that I recently recognised in my learning journey with the bass. But the whole &#039;shiny object&#039; thing is something that can be found in so many things and areas of life, especially in these days of YouTube. It seems to me that that drive to &#039;know more stuff&#039; is very different to actually living what you know through applying it, and that difference can lead to a student (and let&#039;s face it, we&#039;re all students, just at different places in our journey) to thinking that they have mastery over something that they may know in their head but don&#039;t know how to actually use practically. 
Really great to get this exposed and out in the open! Thank you!]]></description>
