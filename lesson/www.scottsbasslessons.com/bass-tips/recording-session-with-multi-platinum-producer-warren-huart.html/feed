		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure if this will help anyone, but I&#039;ll pass along what I did with my recording equipment.
I originally setup my recording equipment with a PodCast in mind.  As such, it biased how I arranged it:
  - 4 microphones
  - 4 headphones
  - 4 volume controls via amplifier box
  - mixer
  - lots of cables

I ordered a multi-colored pack of foam covers for the microphones.  I then ordered a multi-colored pack of nail polish which had the same colors as the foamies.  I then color painted EVERY connection - a vertical paint line on the microphone and a vertical line on the connector _to_ the microphone.  I then painted a vertical line on the other connector (same wire).   I did this for all four microphones, headphones, headphone amplifier (little box) control knobs -- basically the entire audio workflow.  I wanted the ability to look at my mixer, have the connector blazingly obvious what it is and what it goes to.  &quot;Less thinking is more thinking&quot;.  I also wanted a very easy setup and take down process.  Which I now have - connect all the same colors together.

For AC, USB and other odd-ball stuff, I use a color that is different from the audio.  For the MIDI, I use red and green.  One for &#039;in&#039; and one for &#039;out&#039;.  Vertical lines dictating polarity.

Rule 1: Match same color
Rule 2: Dictate orientation
Rule 3: Secondary color dictates function (audio, midi, power, etc)

I can take some pictures of the arrangement if anyone wants.  Hope this helps!

Best!

		<description><![CDATA[Very interesting video! I was a sound engineer when everything was recorded onto 24 track analog tape and I loved it. But I&#039;m fascinated by what can be done nowadays setting up a long distance recording session. No travelling, the confort of your room... And you can sleep an extra hour too! :-)]]></description>
