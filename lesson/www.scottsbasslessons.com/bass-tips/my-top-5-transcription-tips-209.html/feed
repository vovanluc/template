		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for letting me know I&#039;ve actually been transcribing bass parts all these years! I assumed that transcribing HAD to include writing out all the parts that I just &quot;figured out&quot;, which is what I&#039;ve been calling it all this time!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks again Scott.  I recently bought the (inexpensive) Crescendo Music Notation Editor program, so that after learning a bass part I could &#039;write it&#039; down.  The beauty of this program is that it will play what you&#039;ve written, so you can make sure you&#039;ve got it right.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sure seeing it on paper really helps in the analysis, but you could do it all in your head -- just like when your math teacher told you to do every step of long division, rather than skipping to the end.

I loved this lesson. Thanks Scott!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a newbie bass player (long time guitarist), I think a series of courses where you transcribe say 5 classic songs in some genre would be very helpful. Granted, you need to learn to train your own ear (the tips in the lesson are helpful), but throwing the newbs (like me) a few fish by teaching them how to play some classic songs AND explain why it works musically would be great. We need to learn to fish, but sometimes it&#039;s just nice to have someone teach you a lick or line that you can immediately incorporate into your bass vocabulary, especially when you&#039;re just starting out and can&#039;t even put complete sentences together.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for another awesome demo, Scott.

I&#039;ve been learning the bass part (&quot;For a moment the world was a-glow...&quot;) of Mary&#039;s Boy Child - Boney M
No need for the whole song yet because I think that&#039;s the hook that my group will recognize and hopefully make them want to learn it too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Intro defining &quot;transcription,&quot; wise up front.  When I first saw this new lesson I thought, &#039;what does he mean by transcription?&#039;  Aha...he meant what I thought he meant, phew.

Singing it works for me; oftentimes when I pause and turn back to my bass it I hit a wrong note to begin I lose what it was and have to listen and sing again, but that&#039;s usually just at the onset.  

&quot;The goal&quot; is another.  I rarely think of bits and pieces.  I may hear a few bars that get me manic, but then think I need to transcribe the entire piece; that&#039;s much more manageable, especially if you&#039;re not as into the tune as you are what stirs you.

Been working on JPJ&#039;s &quot;Ramble On.&quot;   After watching this lesson I&#039;ll be revisiting Wilton Felder and &quot;I want you back.&quot;  I see you playing it and....&quot;whuh, wuh, wa woo, that&#039;s not what I was doing!&quot;  You just simplified what I had complicated.

A 5 tips are on target and greatly appreciated.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting Scott. When I was studying with some pretty heavy weight players in NYC, when they said transcribe at tune, they always meant write it down. I would transcribe a tune or solo and my teacher would make me play it and then tell him what the changes were or why did he play this line against those changes. I&#039;m not sure how you would be able to learn the theory behind the music without writing it down.]]></description>
