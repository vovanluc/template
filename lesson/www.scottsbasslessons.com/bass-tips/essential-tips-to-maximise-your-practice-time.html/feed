		<description><![CDATA[Dear Scott, thanks for all your tips and lessons, I really learn a lot from them! When you say transcribe do you mean essentially learning music/lines by ear? My question is because my ear perception is awful, and I mostly learn new songs seeing people playing on the internet or reading tabs... What are your thoughts on that? Thanks again!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Holy crap. I think you just saved my sanity. I&#039;ve been asking my wife if she&#039;s noticed a smoke/CO battery alarm and she hasn&#039;t. I&#039;m not smart enough to realize that I only hear it when a lesson is on my computer.

Thank you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just a complete different remark: What is this beep which comes from time to time in the videos ? It sounds like a smoke detector, complaining about low battery power ;-) So first times I heard it, I inspected my detectors just to relize, that the sound came from the video ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey X,Y Man.. I understand what you&#039;re saying, In my 40&#039;s, I&#039;ve been playing for a while now and after so many years of playing, bands and recordings besides juggling work schedules, I hit that wall ever so often.. however now the effort is to keep myself inspired (like Scott mentions above) and listen to new stuff (just like reading helps for speaking), and play along with new stuff.. You may also like to change tone settings, play around with effects, etc to keep off from the monotony of the same tone for your ears.. (I play some guitars so that helps me to switch) download some drum loops / beats and lock with it.. its good fun..  hope this helps in some lil way..  and Scott you are such an inspiration and pleasure to listen to.. All the Best! CheersGod Bless!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love doing it but i i&#039;m definitely going to take a break from it for a while.
Since i started playing about 3 years ago i&#039;ve only had about 3 days where i haven&#039;t played and that was through illness.
I think i have done it far too much with hours and hours of practice to get to a level where i can play along with tracks and also decipher lines for myself by listening to them.


I need a break before i start getting into chords and all the other technical stuff in a big way !]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The question is, why do we pick up an instrument at all?  Is it to get rich? Famous?  The idea sounds nice, but usually the drive is because there is something inside us that needs to get out.  An inspired painter paints, a photographer takes photos, and a musician plays.  
Playing to the point of pain is never the goal and counter productive as you have figured out.  By the way, that pain in your hands should get looked at.
You play because you like to.  And you don&#039;t play because you don&#039;t like to.  I found that putting down the bass for a while was actually good for me.  It reset my ears, my hands, and the reason it made me happy, and found I could play more relaxed than when I put it down.
Maybe this instrument isn&#039;t for you after all.  I think the most important thing is realizing there is something inside you that needs to be creative in some way. If it&#039;s not the bass guitar then so be it.  Good luck to you, brother.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think i&#039;m going to have to call time on Bass playing for a while because i have sickened myself with it.
I&#039;ve been trying for three years now just as a hobby but it has now become a chore.
I&#039;m in my early forties now so i don&#039;t think i&#039;ll get anywhere near a stage and i don&#039;t know any musicians, So i&#039;m questioning why i&#039;m putting myself through this.
My wrists are just about shot and i have pain in my thumb which feels like an electric shock when i put it on the back of the neck.
I have now stopped learning from my books and it seems like being back at school and no fun at all.


I think you have to question yourself when you wake up with a Bass Guitar still in your hands which has nearly smashed the living room window when you have fallen asleep with it in your hands whilst watching the television lol]]></description>
