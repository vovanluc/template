		<description><![CDATA[Your timing is impeccable, and I don&#039;t just mean your playing:-)  A few weeks ago I emailed SBL a question about left hand positioning when sight-reading new charts.  Knowing you&#039;re really busy, I emailed the same question to Chuck Rainey.  Interestingly Chuck (like my first teacher, Carol Kaye) replied that you can cover almost all the notes you&#039;ll need by pivoting on your thumb and covering the first five frets.  Whilst that may be true I&#039;ve never felt completely comfortable with that technique.  After 4 decades of reading I&#039;ve &#039;found&#039; that your &quot;second finger on the root of the key&quot; works almost all the time; especially on a five string bass.  If only I&#039;d had you as my teacher in 1972!  Keep up the good work:-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great lesson Scott i&#039;ve been waiting for this lesson for awhile! Using this concept/technique i&#039;ve realized I can visualize if say the chord players made a substitution in the harmony and i could kinda guess whats happening. Whats a good way to really &#039;see&#039; it? What are some common substitutions like b7, IIImaj7th etc. or even seeing Melodies in relations to the chords/harmony? As my Pianist and guitarist has always been able to &#039;visualize&#039; this somehow..]]></description>
