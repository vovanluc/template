		<description><![CDATA[Excellent! This is helping me a lot in believing in my own capacity to play bass.  Since forever, the first instrument i&#039;m earing in music has always been the bass.  In my yonger years i loved disco for the bass and kick drums. (I also listen to some rock music like STYX, Pat Benatar etc...) At the time i was dreaming of playing bass but life then and bullying burried that dream.  I tough I would never ever play bass until i found out about SBL academy. As Jan said, my brain has seen better days... my hands too...  I&#039;m now 52 and an absolute beginer.  I realize it&#039;s gonna be a lot a work. (a lot more than anticipated)  But i have so much fun in learning and developing my skills. The wonderful videos and seminars are helping so much, all this in a positive and civilized manner.  I used to fix goals in life but for the bass, my goal now is to have fun, to go on and climb the next step without skipping. The foundations are of the utmost importance and I&#039;ll take the time it takes to do it right.  Thank you so much Scott and all the Team at SBL academy for allowing me to bring to life an old dream.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think my take on this is...long term success over short term gain. Let me explain. In today&#039;s society with technology we have been conditioned to getting instantaneous responses or what I call instantaneous gratification. So if something takes time to master, most tend to say its to hard. The flip side to this is someone who takes a longer view and works consistently over time tends to be considered super talented or lucky. 

Luck maybe, talent maybe but this just an insties (yep made that word up) way of dealing with what they are seeing. I have often been told now I am in my fifties that I am to slow I need to work faster, drive faster, eat faster and so on it goes. I call it the speed over accuracy equation. The faster the speed the less accuracy. So I feel at times that this world has passed me by literally. I feel sometimes and even think there must be something wrong with me as I have to work at getting better at what I do. 

In this video Scott confirms what I have always known. To be good at something takes time, effort and persistence. The other thing to add to this video is that we are often our own worst critic. When we have achieved something with our bass playing and we know we have we often say nah not good enough. Yet others tell us that hey man that was some cool playing and our response, well in my case, is to say it was OK but i should have done better. I should say hey its OK to say to yourself job well done when you say finally get that bass line down on a song and kick butt with the song when playing live. I know I have done that recently in my bass playing life. 

Last point in my long winded diatribe. I do apologise for the length. I agree 100% with Scott that there will always be someone out there better than yourself. To me that should be inspiration that we have not yet learnt all there is to learn. I remember when I was a child waking up in the morning and being excited about what the day would bring. Now I am much older I find it increasingly difficult to hold onto that wonder of what the day will bring. What I find helps is not to get sucked into that negative downward spiral of that it is all not worth it, whats the point, we can&#039;t do anything mantras which seem to be espoused a thousand times a day via many different medias. For me I often listen to meditation style music by the likes of Terry Oldfield or Medwyn Goodall. It lifts my spirits and helps me be positive about my day and I feel I want to practice my bass playing not do it because I have to. 

To my fellow bass players remember as Zaphod Beeblebrox said...Keep banging those rocks together...For those not familiar with Zaphods sayings, Keep at it. It will be worth the time, effort and persistence. 

Thanks Scott for reminding me Rome was not built in a day.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jan,

Congratulations on your accomplishment!  Your focus and determination are an inspiration to me.  Keep up the strong work!  

Please reconsider your thoughts about playing with others.  I know lots of young musicians who would enjoy jamming with a cool old lady bass player!  Also, your experienced friends would do well to jam with you.  If they have been playing for 40+ years, it&#039;s because they got a lot of help from more experienced musicians.  You might give them the chance to pay some of that back.

If you have a local music school nearby, I&#039;d suggest looking to see if they assemble student jams or music camps.  They often put together bands with students of like ability.

Thank you for your note and for taking up the bass.  You are making the world a better place with every note you play!

		<description><![CDATA[Way to go Jan.
IMHO it is the journey and not the destination that is key.
Enjoy the music you make. Enjoy your bass. Enjoy each note you play. Each note has meaning.
Don&#039;t wait for the point when you are finally a virtuoso. No true musician every gets to that point. The learning process is constant.
What counts is that you enjoy what you do. If there are people around or not.
Cheers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott is right.
&quot;Talent&quot; &quot;helps&quot; but is not the deciding factor IMHO.
Your love for whatever it is you do is the deciding factor and that is what keeps you going and makes you reach for &quot;the next level&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent video. I lived my first 61 years believing I could never play anything.  Despite that belief I started to take bass lessons, figuring I have good rhythm so how hard could it be. Oh, my. 

Truth is, if I had know how hard it was going to be and how bad I was I never would have tried. Over the last 4 years I&#039;ve had some really heavy &quot;life&quot; stuff come up, but I haven&#039;t stopped. 

Also, I have always been a good academic student, am organized, and am over educated. I must have been such a pain in the butt as a music student  in the beginning. I am now going back over the fundamentals and really digging in with the metronome and chord tones up and down the neck. I&#039;m working on my right hand technique. Im doing ear training, something I thought was hopeless for me.  Im even beginning transcribing. 

Not only do I think I have little talent, I have a brain that has seen better days.  Who cares? I am now practicing a minimum of 1 hour a day, usually closer to 3 hours a day. 

I don&#039;t have friends to form a band with me. No garage jams for my peers. They have either been playing for 40+ years, or they aren&#039;t crazy enough to start at this age. The folks just learning are like, 14, and I&#039;m pretty sure 1) they don&#039;t want an old lady around, and 2) they would pass me in 3 months. The latter is just the reality of neurology. 

The take away from this video for me is that I don&#039;t really know how far I will go with bass. Maybe I will be ale to do a full set in a couple of years. My goal right now is to be able to have a conversation when playing, if that makes sense. I have begun to find small riffs that I love when I am practing  pentatonics. I think I&#039;m finding my voice. 

So thanks, Scott. I&#039;m just going to keep working at it.
