		<description><![CDATA[In transcribing from digital audio files rather than videos, some digital players allow you to adjust the speed of playback (say 90% or 80% of regular speed).  Being digital, changing the playback speed doesn&#039;t change the pitch.  This helps me tremendously in determining what&#039;s going on in more intricate passages.  Unfortunately, iTunes doesn&#039;t seem to have this playback feature, but is is available on the music player included on my Samsung Galaxy 4 notebook.  I have also just downloaded the Song Surgeon 4 app that is supposed to support variable speed playback as well as the ability to record the results.  It&#039;s also supposed to allow you to change the pitch if you want to learn in a different key.  So I should be able to record just the difficult sections of songs that I am working on without having to find these passages in the full length recording, which should speed up the process.  Here&#039;s a link to the CNET review of this app: http://download.cnet.com/Song-Surgeon/3000-2170_4-10782384.html if anyone is interested.  Again, I haven&#039;t tried it yet, but it may be worth checking out their free demo.  Hope this helps.]]></description>
