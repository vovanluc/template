		<description><![CDATA[Good interview.  Dishan is a cool guy with some solid tips in his master class videos.  BTW, Scott, it&#039;s funny that when you asked him about his Bass, he said he was a 1 Bass guy, and he plays a MM Stingray, and only when he can get away with it, he uses the P Bass.  But if you listen back, you steered him into talking only about the P Bass.  We all know how much you love your Fender man.  And that&#039;s cool. But that was a chance to at least discuss the difference between the two.  Talk Bass has 14 pages of discussion on the topic.  Thanks as always though for brining us first class instruction in so many formats.                        https://www.talkbass.com/threads/choosing-my-forever-bass-stingray-vs-precision.1091974/]]></description>
