		<description><![CDATA[It has taken me a few weeks to catch up with Todd&#039;s webcast.
I have really enjoyed the lessons Todd has done with SBL, so was looking forward to this interview.
Todd comes accross in the interview as he has with the classes: a genuinely nice and humble man who has put himself through a lot to learn what he knows, and is keen and willing to share his knowledge with anyone else who is hungry to learn.
Thanks to Todd for being Todd, and to Scott for being so broad-minded as to bring in other bass educators to help us students on our journey with bass.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great interview, and Todd is great, but I think 99% of us use tab for some stuff, and will never be professional musicians, so IMO the comment about tab is snobby.  For that matter, proper sheet music leaves out a lot too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I watched the entire podcast and it&#039;s amazing how much valuable information there is in it. I was just going through another round of thinking that I needed more to read to encourage myself to continue practicing since I had been stuck for about a month now. And then Todd pulled out the two books (props!), &quot;The Practicing Mind&quot; by Thomas Sterner and &quot;The Practice of Practice&quot; by Jonathan Harnum. I ordered them last night. If they helped Todd and his students, I&#039;m sure these can help me, as well, plus help my Freshman Engineering students coming to college this September. And Scott was just so encouraging about how practicing walking bass lines really helped him learn harmony and the fingerboard. Virtually EVERYTHING Todd and Scott were discussing rang so true to me and was just exactly what I needed to hear. In the past, I have practiced many of the topics they discussed. It was like they were discussing my own unique situation, which is probably more like the Same situation for the vast majority of bass players out there! This was an extremely helpful Podcast for me at just the right time! One  that I hope to re-listen to many times over!

Thanks for a great 81 minutes of encouragement, instruction, and great mind fusion (almost like it was scripted)!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m only 16 min into watching this and I&#039;m blown away! What a great story of becoming a bass player from grade school up to age 29. Hey man, I&#039;m 57, just 2 years older, and can relate to all that you&#039;ve shared. I was at VaTech Elec Engg Grad school reading about MI when you went there in 1990! I remember those ads! Boy did I really desire to go, but my path was laid out. Anyway, now I&#039;m a beginner again, after 14 years, and finished going through your Module book 1. That&#039;s where I branched out from Root-Five to Root-Three! A milestone. Now inspired to continue practicing tonight for more walking bass lines. Will continue watching your podcast afterwards. Enjoyed watching your Motown video you recently posted on your weekly video site. 1-5-8 is the coolest. I appreciate you as a person and a teacher. Thanks Todd!]]></description>
