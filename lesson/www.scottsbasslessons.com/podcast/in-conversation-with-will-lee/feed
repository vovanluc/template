		<description><![CDATA[Sorry to say the technology was not up to the standard Scott has set for the SBL podcasts. Will Lee was an enthusiastic interviewee, but Scott&#039;s questioning style was less effective than the style he usually adopts in the more comfortable SBL style.
However, still great to hear the stories from these world-class guys, and the modesty of the bass player: to support the music and the soloist.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Will is amazing.  I walked into Manny&#039;s Car Wash many years ago and happened upon him, 
playing with Hiram, and I bought the CD.  Their playing was so musical, rhythmical.  One thing that never came up was
Will&#039;s singing.  His singing/playing gives him added value in all these projects.  And his voice is very versatile.  Scott, 
that was a great interview.  There&#039;s so much to talk about with a guy like this.]]></description>
