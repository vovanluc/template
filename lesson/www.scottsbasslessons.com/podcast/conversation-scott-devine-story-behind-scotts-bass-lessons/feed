		<description><![CDATA[So glad you did this!! It&#039;s an inspiring story for sure!! One of the best parts of my day is when I can kick back and peruse your site and find something new to work on. You&#039;ve made me a much better player. Can&#039;t thank you enough for starting this site.... You could literally NOT add any new content for years and I&#039;d STILL have stuff to work on... SOOOOOO much great stuff, sooo little time! LOL!!! I love SBL!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is great just watched your first youtube video and man you have come a long way. As a self taught bassist I&#039;ve always looked for help/inspiration on youtube. I finally stumbled upon SBL around 2012 and its been a primary source of music education for me. Now as a parent and 9-5 worker, i can be more appreciative of these lessons and the academy that has helped me grow immensely as a bass player. Not only because this information is laid out for me but because now I have confidence that what I am practicing is the right stuff which makes motivation that much easier. Thanks so much for these resources and congratulations on your business success Scott!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Biggest thing for me -- your wife (Lisa) making you stop and think about what you were going to do (Luthier vs SBL).  There is absolutely nothing like having someone who knows you well enough to offer gentle guidance or just the suggestion to pause and think things through.  On behalf of everyone who has benefited from your hard work Scott -- give Lisa a great big hug from us.  Love you man.]]></description>
