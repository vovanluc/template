		<description><![CDATA[Just a fantastic, energetic, amazing podcast. Loved hearing her story, how she came to America, how she was so absorbed in her music classes and studies and practicing, etc. How difficult it was to come into the music scene, to make a living doing it, teaching lessons, then writing her book. I loved hearing about how she put in so much effort to get this far. Wow! Very inspiring. There should be a part two, i want to hear about the course she put together to teach her music theory for bass players, I want to hear about her using sports psychology and other psych learning methods to good use. I want to hear about her principles of teaching and learning and how she motivates her students. Please bring her back for Part 2!]]></description>
