		<description><![CDATA[Scott, another great interview. As I said in a comment on one of the earlier podcasts, you have a great interview technique: asking a few questions and allowing the interviewee to talk. Chris comes across as a really nice, unassuming kind of guy: a trait shared so far amongst the players you have interviewed - perhaps something all bassists share. I get the impression these folk open up because they appreciate you share their feelings, knowledge and experience as a bassist. This really is a terrific series of interviews, and such a great insight for those of us on the journey who haven&#039;t yet found the buffet car on the train of bass experience. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[LEARN YOUR FINGERBOARD.  This was an awesome lesson.  The exercises he shared would keep me busy for years.  It flows back to a question I asked Scott and Geoff about the one thing that really kick started their playing on bass -- they both said learning the fingerboard.  Awesome episode as always Scott.  I&#039;m inspired as usual.]]></description>
