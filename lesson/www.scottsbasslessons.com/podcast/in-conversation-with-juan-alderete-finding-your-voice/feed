		<description><![CDATA[Yep you got it in one they help with muting, you see them a lot not just for slapping but generally in solo performing where you&#039;re doing a lot more on the bass than you&#039;d do playing a standard bass line]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott.
Very interesting conversation. It&#039;s always interesting to hear stories from players of this level.

I have a very stupid question.
What is the use of the piece of strap Andrew has on top of the fingerboard on the last example video you posted?
I&#039;ve seen it on other bassist instruments but I don&#039;t know what is it for.
Is it for muting strings while slapping?
Regards.]]></description>
