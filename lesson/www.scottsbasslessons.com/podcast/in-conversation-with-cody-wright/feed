		<description><![CDATA[Caught him with the fourcestra in Syracuse NY, a few years back. Went to the show on a recommendation with some friends. It made me rethink pick on bass. Gave him a big bass hug and a handshake, even went on stage with the band while they were playing because it was a small show and they wanted it to be more intimate. Humble dude!]]></description>

It is mind blowing to hear the range of Cody&#039;s influences, especially when he mentioned trying to transcribe Art Tatum on the piano.]]></description>
