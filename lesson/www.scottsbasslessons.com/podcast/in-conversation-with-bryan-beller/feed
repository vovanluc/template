		<description><![CDATA[This was a great story. Beller is one of my absolute bass heroes and it was interresting to hear his journey through many different experiences to the level he is on now. He seems as a very nice person too and thank you Bryan for the good advice you share with us. I have seen you in concert several times in Copenhagen through the last several years. It has been a great pleasure to listen to you and a great thank you to Scott and SBL for making this possible.]]></description>
