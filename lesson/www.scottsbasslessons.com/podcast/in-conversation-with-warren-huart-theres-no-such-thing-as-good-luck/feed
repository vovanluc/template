		<description><![CDATA[Catching up, post Christmas. I enjoyed your previous sessions with Warren on remote recording. You obviously have a good relationship with Warren, and the interview is like listening in on a conversation as if nothing was prepared. It is clear, however, that you have diligently researched, and guide the conversation. Thoroughly enjoyable and full of interesting tales and tit-bits - thank you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My god so much information.Loved it all but I have to say the part where you talked about players selling them selves short really rang true for me, something I think I&#039;ve done to myself a lot over my years on the planet. Self confidence, believing in yourself and I believe being afraid of being successful, that we can sabotage ourselves. With out going into the gory details, getting back into playing, practicing etc has been a life saver. If there is one thing I would like to share with upcoming musicians is don&#039;t sell yourselves short and work hard, believe in yourselves and by that I don&#039;t mean on an ego trip way. Be a real person. Echoing what you two were talking about. Thanks guys.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott,
That was a great interview man!  I had heard of Chris Chaney from Bass player mag, but was not really into Janes addiction, but this guy really inspires you to learn to read and learn your theory, Chris seems like he got where he is with a lot of hard work and we can all benefit from that.  ]]></description>
