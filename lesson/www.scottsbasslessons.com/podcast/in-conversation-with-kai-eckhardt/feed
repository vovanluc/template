		<description><![CDATA[It was a pleasure to meet Kai at this year&#039;s Warwick Bass Camp, albeit on the &#039;Meet and Greet&#039;.
I had only heard of Kai by reputation, but he was graceful and signed a &#039;Meet and Greet&#039; card after a short conversation.
I wish I had heard his story from Scott&#039;s podcast and maybe got to chat with him at the grand supper.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Outstanding interview with Kai.  He is such a free spirit and a great role model.  I was blessed to meet him here in Dayton, Ohio years ago at Gilly&#039;s where he performed along with Billy Cobham. Both he and Billy were very down to earth.  It was a great pleasure to be in their company. Thanks for sharing the podcast.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great stuff from Kai, I can relate as I had to give up a portion of my life for my mom who had severe Alzheimers too. You can grow from stuff like this. You learn about how prescious life is. Life is creativity(music) and a string to the divine. Ego is negative energy. I bet Kai has had trance moments playing music. Finding compassion is a freedom. https://youtu.be/E_ERGynR-CM]]></description>
