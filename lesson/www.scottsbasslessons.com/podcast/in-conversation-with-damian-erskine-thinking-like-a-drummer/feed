		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott! 
Really great pod! It just give me a sweet feeling listening and learning to you and Damian. Great vibes and lots of knowledge thrown around. 

suggestion for improvement: (I am an mixing engineer and that maybe makes me a bit sensitive to this, but..) if you make sure rec levels are not over -12dbfs and instead use a compressor and some limiting in the post process to bring the audio up, things wont distort. :) And i have noticed in other videos that your microphone is often falling around pointing at the room instead of your head. when in the middle of a conversation that cant be fixed of course. but if you use a small headset fixed to your chin (The ones that actors and singers and such use. DPA makes really great skin colored ones) that problem will go away. 

(sorry if i sound harsh. english is not my first language. i am just trying to help making everything as good as it possibly can!)

Regards
Niclas]]></description>
