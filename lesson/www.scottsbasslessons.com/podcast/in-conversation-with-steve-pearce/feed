		<description><![CDATA[LOVED this podcast!  LOVE Steve&#039;s playing with Brother Strut and was sorry to see him go.  Also, sorry that his huge popularity and growing public persona has facilitated the deactivation of his personal Facebook account where we were friends.  I considered our FB friendship part of my education as a bassist, especially one who came to bass later in life and who needs as many &quot;PhD&quot; type friendships as possible.  Loved the interview.  I would love to hear more from Steve on any and every subject related to Bass and Music!  Best, Lanaya]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, another great interview. There has been something in common in the UK interviews you have done, but I can&#039;t quite put my finger on it. I&#039;m pretty sure it has something to do with having a good time, playing live music and making musician friends, in the days of smoky British pubs.]]></description>
