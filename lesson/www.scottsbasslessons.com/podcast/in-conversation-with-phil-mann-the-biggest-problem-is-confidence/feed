		<description><![CDATA[Congratulations Scott.  This is your best interview so far.  Dave&#039;s story is interesting and entertaining and contained so much applicable information.  It was also a good reminder that 99% of the bass player&#039;s job does not require virtuoso techniques!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Years ago, (I&#039;m talking YEARS, now) Jools&#039; Later show was broadcast in the States, I believe on NBC, late on Sunday nights.  Of course I was aware of Jools from Squeeze, and thought the show and concept was AMAZING.  It might&#039;ve ran for only a couple seasons.  Nowadays we can see it on cable channel MTVLive (formerly Palladium channel), and they&#039;ll have anything from a show 10 years old, or one of the more recent ones.  Unfortunately I don&#039;t subscribe to the MTVLive channel, and only get to see it when the satellite company gives a free preview for about a week or so.  And every time they do I think about subscribing, particularly for that show.  Now I know to look for Dave the next time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great interview with an interesting articulate guy. Particularly pertinent were his comments about flash playing and the importance of serving the song. Sadly, the majority of people who listen to music don&#039;t appreciate what a bass player does and some even don&#039;t know what one is. Hence there can be an unfulfilled desire for recognition. I even think there can be a lack of appreciation from other &#039;lead&#039; musicians.]]></description>
