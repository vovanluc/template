		<description><![CDATA[How are you getting on with that Yamaha mini-amp behind you, Scott? Are you using it at all for practice or is it the guest guitarist amp?

I&#039;m currently using a small Warwick amp in my living room here in Tokyo. (Big amps forbidden in most Japanese apartment buildings). I&#039;ve been looking at that Yamaha or a small EBS amp for a bedroom practice amp. I was surprised by the Yamaha in the store, but that was on a noisy shop floor. The EBS sounded great in another store with an FGN J-bass. ]]></description>
