		<description><![CDATA[Downloaded the app. Gary, I know you probably got advice on the pricing from somone, but in my opionion, this is overpriced.  It&#039;s a nice looking app, well produced and designed with good controls.  The idea of a Groove a Day is brilliant.  And I appreciate this.  It really pushes our practice.  But at 1.00 a track it&#039;s entirely too much.  I&#039;m suggesting .25 per track, which would still yield you 90.50 for your app, which is much more in line with what most practicing/working musicians can afford and are wililng to pay for a music app, software, program or course.  Think about it, once you&#039;ve done the work it&#039;s essentially passive income that you can enjoy.  But if it doesn&#039;t sell, it&#039;ll be like an overpriced home on the market and it won&#039;t take long before someone else creates something like it that will be much less.  This is all said with great respect, so forgive me if I come across too bold.]]></description>
