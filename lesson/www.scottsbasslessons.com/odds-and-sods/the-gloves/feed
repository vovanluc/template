		<description><![CDATA[Good on you mate, for sharing your great wealth of knowledge. I have also been afflicted with a debilitating condition that has kept me from doing nearly as much playing out as I once did. I&#039;ve been a musician for 37 years. Nearly five years ago I was playing regularly with three bands and doing some session work. One night in the middle of the first song of our set, I started missing changes and forgetting what key we played every song in.

After some labwork and a few doctors visits I was diagnosed with acute encephalopathy onset from NASH Disease. Now I check your lessons weekly to retrain myself as I have forgotten what nearly 30 years of pro playing had taught me. I cannot thank you enough for providing these lessons!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, 

Well what can I say, about 6 months ago I started getting twitches and spasms in my left hand, mostly when I was playing or oddly doing D.I.Y. it really started to bother me especially as the Doctors and specialists started throwing around &quot;Parkinson&#039;s&quot; into the conversations. I stopped playing for a while which really upset me. I have been playing since I was 8 so some 33 years. I started back with my old band despite the twitching and have just learned to live wit it, some songs are more difficult than others, but I enjoy playing so much I don&#039;t let it bother me now, I tend to stick to simple runs but hey. Then I chanced upon your YOUTUBE and subsequently your website and what a revelation. I don&#039;t know if what you describe is the same as what I have but the other day I tried playing with latex gloves and whether it was psychosomatic or what, but it really made a difference. I cannot convey just how much reading about your condition and how you combat it has firstly made my bass playing more relaxed and trouble free, but it has changed my outlook on what my condition might  be. No more doom and gloom. So a huge huge thanks. Can I just ask though what gloves you use and where can I source them, I am eager to see if they make a bigger difference as the latex ones do, as you say they stick to the strings and don&#039;t really last.

Thanks again for the help. You are a life saver truly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,

I&#039;ve been following your video&#039;s on YouTube and have been spending quite a bit of time on your website. I studied piano when I was younger, still play, and goofed around with the bass (and other instruments) in high school. I can read music and everything but want to know the techniques and how to develop the skills, to playing bass well/smoothly. I noticed that you wore a glove and was curious about it. When I played piano I&#039;d sit far on the right of the bench and always with a boot on, play the pedal with my left leg. I have spina bifida, a neurological condition where my spinal cord was on the outside of my spine when I was born. I&#039;m about 98% paralyzed from the waist down but, for reasons no one can figure out, I CAN fire 1 of the 3 muscles in my left quads. Wearing a boot, and putting my heal, not toe, on the pedal, it hits the sustain. The boot is heavy enough to press the pedal, and with the super little movement I have, it&#039;s JUST enough to release the pedal to kill the sustain. It looks awkward the way I sit, but it works. 

I was curious about your glove and wondered if it maybe something similar. I thought maybe it was a grip-thing and sometimes squeezing, wrapping the hands, can aide in squeezing ones hand. I wasn&#039;t too far off. I think it&#039;s cool. Sometimes it doesn&#039;t matter why it works or how, it&#039;s just that it does. I&#039;ve had a lot of health issues lately. I&#039;ve wracked-up a ridiculous amount of spinal cord and brain surgeries the last 2-3 years, like WAY too many. So I&#039;ve been out of commission and at home a lot. I picked up a bass one day and figured, &quot;What the hell? Sitting here all day might as well learn something&quot;. I&#039;m shocked at the amount of free information you have shared with the world. It&#039;s inspirational that someone ISN&#039;T after every nickel they can. There is a wealth of knowledge you&#039;ve made accessible and I&#039;m taking advantage of it. Hopefully you get some good Karmic Feedback.

I just wanted to comment on the alternative medicine. I&#039;m always amazed at how many people have one little thing happen, see a specialist for &quot;X - Disease&quot; or have friend with &quot;whatever&quot;, and suddenly they are doctors. It isn&#039;t about western medicine, alternative medicine, vegan diets, anti-medication, etc. It&#039;s about learning as much as possible, hearing EVERY &quot;PROFESSIONAL&quot; opinion, doing unbiassed research and obviously, YOU making the decision. As the saying goes, &quot;you are you&#039;re best advocate&quot;.  Sometimes it takes a balance of multiple things. One of the worst things someone can do, is think they can be their own doctor. You can&#039;t replace medical school with the internet or that &#039;thing that you&#039;re friends mother did&quot;. People expect miracles with western medicine and when they don&#039;t get it, they doubt it all. I&#039;ve tried tons of different things, many didn&#039;t work or made things worse, but eventually, I found something that, along with a bunch of other things, helped. Took two years and about a dozen different medications to find what worked. 

I wish you the best of luck. Thanks so much for sharing what you have learned through the years. You&#039;re very talented!

Cheers]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You may want to look into LDN (Low Dose Naltrexone) I went to 20 doctors over three years looking for relief from CFIDS/Fibro, under the care of an immunologist and was put on expensive stuff like Lyrica, but LDN did more than the pain meds or ATP injections and the rest! Look up the LDN foundation.
Good luck!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just discovered your series and subscribed immediately.  A few things...

- Started on drums in 1960 when I was 12.  Mom made me take guitar lessons so I&#039;d give up the drums.  Silly mom...  But it led me to guitar, bass and some keys.  
- Played in bands all over NYC &#039;til I got married in &#039;71 and moved to Joisey.  No serious playing for many years.
- Started hearing bass lines in my head in 2000.  When medication didn&#039;t help, I picked up a used bass and amp and started getting into it. Knew my way around a fretboard plus fingerpicking an acoustic guitar gave me the right hand skills.
- In 2003, my cousin Greg (keys) talked me into going to The National Guitar Workshop for a week.  Took blues bass master classes five summers in a row.
- Greg and I started a blues band in 2004...I was 56 and he was 60...we were nuts.  But we were soon 13 pieces with FIVE HORNS...and my daughter Kate was on lead vocals doing Joplin, Raitt, BB King, etc.  I also sing lead and harmony while playing bass.  Must be a leftover from my drummer days when every part of your body did something different independently.
- Now I&#039;m 65+ and play bass for a small blues band outside of Fort Worth, TX.  We practice every week and play out 2-3 times a month.  Not only do you never stop learning...you NEVER STOP PLAYING...AND GIGGING!!!!!

Also saw and read about your gloves.  I&#039;ve been diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my fingers.  Not good when you play bass and work in IT (42 years).  There are neoprene compression gloves for arthritis (Amazon).  They give me some relief on a daily basis.  Thinking of seeing if they help on a 4-hour gig.  Let you know if they are &quot;playable&quot;.

Love the lessons.  Give me plenty of new ideas.  Have been dying to learn a little slap.  Thanks for your dedication, sense of humor and giving spirit.  It is greatly appreciated.

John

PS: Check out my newest bass at www.ergoinstruments.com.  Look at the EUB4...60&quot; of solid mahogany on a chrome tripod.  A full electric fretless upright without the body.  It is a kickass &quot;stick&quot; to play!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,

I have played bass for about 35 years.  For the last 20 or so, I have had an autoimmune condition and limited mobility in my wrists.  Nothing like what you endure, but I know what it&#039;s like to play bass with limitations.  

I&#039;m really glad to have stumbled across your videos!  I have decent chops, but my theory has always been rather weak, so my horizons are expanding thanks to you. 

A lot of people have chimed in with health advice.  At the risk of being pedantic, I will throw my 2 cents in as well.  I got turned on to a water system, that alkalizes the water as it purifies it.  Mine is a Kangen/Enagic machine, but there are other manufacturers out there.  It&#039;s better than bottled water, RO water, tap water, or anything else, and it allows your body to heal itself better and faster.  

After being on that water for a couple months, I could bend over and touch my toes, something I couldn&#039;t do in the 10 years prior.  Give it a shot, it&#039;s something you can do along with any other treatment you do, and the worst that can happen is nothing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott, 
Now you gotta one more Brazilian fan and subscriber ! 
I Have played in a Rock and Heavy Metal band as a teenager, growing up started studying, working and just play for fun now. 
Found you while looking for Groove lessons ( wanna mix rock with tha dancy groove ).

Congratulation, I like the lessons a lot and now that I learned about the condition you have and the gloves I respect you even more ass a bass player, and great example of a human being. 

Keep on rocking (grooving, soloing, jazzing ... )

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott. I just stumbled across your lessons and I knew I&#039;d found what I&#039;d been looking for. I&#039;m entirely self-taught by ear but I&#039;ve reached a plateau. You&#039;re the first guy (or gal) I&#039;ve found who has all three necessary qualities in an effective teacher: talented, accessible, and likeable. A triple threat! I&#039;ll definitely do the &quot;like&quot; thing and follow your lessons.

I&#039;m also a doctor (sorry, not a neurologist) and, in spite of what a lot of folks here say, I don&#039;t lie. As you can tell here, everyone has an absolute idea about what will cure a problem, but few people really try to hold that idea up to scrutiny in a scientific way. Everyone here means well, but please be careful about taking all sorts of health advice. Just because conventional medicine hasn&#039;t got everything figured out yet doesn&#039;t mean everyone else has. Desperation can lead to some silly things. I&#039;m thrilled that you reclaimed your passion with something so simple as a pair of gloves, and I admire you for being ready to find satisfaction in other ways if you hadn&#039;t found a solution. 

Best regards, thank you, and, when I can find another moment, I&#039;ll get in the shed.]]></description>
