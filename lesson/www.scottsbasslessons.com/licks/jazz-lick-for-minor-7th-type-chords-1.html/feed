		<description><![CDATA[I know you are asking scott, but when a chord contains a 7th, instead of there being a 2nd, a 4th, and a 6th, they would then become the 9th 11th and 13th, as well as the # and b of each. So when you se a 
g-7(b9) the chord would be spelled G Bb D F Ab.. Hope that helps. Also they are referred to as tensions. When the chord does not contain a 7th, that is when you will see add 2 add 4 add 6 as well as the # and b of each. Hope that makes since]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Trying hard to wrap my little brain around music theory or music term usage:  :-)

A few questions in that context:

1. You mention the F# in the context of Emin as being the &quot;9th&quot;, even though
the F# is the 2nd note in the Emin scale..is that the convention to identify the 2nd
as the 9th, even though the notes are in the same octave?

2. Would it be accurate to identify the lick in an Emin context as being Emin11?
    and in a Gmaj context as Gmaj13..or maybe Gmaj6/9 since there is no 11?
     E   F#   G     B  D  A                               G  A B   D  E        F# 
     1 2(9)   b3   5  7  4 (11)                         1 9  3  5  6(13)   7  

Well, even more pertinent, are the naming conventions strict or the usage more dependant on how the user learned them.  :-)

Thx]]></description>
