		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, I have been taking lessons from Andres Rotmistrovsky from NYC.  He is an amazing teacher and a great mentor, but I recently had to stop for financial reasons.  I then found your website, and I want to thank you for all the great lessons that you posted.  Now I can continue to advance my playing at a price I can afford at the moment (free)!  Actually, I joined your site and having the PDF&#039;s is a huge help.  Keep up the great work and thanks for donating your time and talent to those who need it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott,
Greetings from South Florida. 
Buddy you just nailed it! Your explanation really helped me in understanding and finding ways to explore more into licks and lines. Really awesome. I appreciate you taking the time to have these lessons available. 
I don&#039;t have much time to dig deeper into music theory, but you really make it easy and transparent. 
Great job!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great lesson and well explained. Noticed your 5 string bass has a C for 1st string. Thought it was a regular 5 string G,D,A,E,B at first. Realized it when you started playing the lick at 12th fret. Have you considered using a standard 4 string for these videos since most everyone has one. Most bassist I know do not have a 5 string like yours.

Cheers!

		<description><![CDATA[I noticed the resolution you spoke of (the minor 7th of the 2 chord resolving to the 3rd of the 5 chord) didn&#039;t necessarily function as the resolution (at least in the context of the actual chord tones) when the altered the phrasing. But it still sounds sweet? (:]]></description>

 I have been learning the bass for close to three years now and your tutorials have been more helpful than the two or three teachers I have had.
