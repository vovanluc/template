				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this lesson I’ve just released I’m going to show you an epic bass lick you can use over *ANY* chord!</p>
<p>Seriously... whatever groove you’re playing, whatever chord you’re playing over, you can use this lick - but the secret is the placement and timing of how you use it.</p>
<p>As always, I'd love to hear from you guys in the comments!</p>
<p>See you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. I actually stole this lick from a bass player you’ll most likely have heard 100’s if not 1000’s of times before (he’s one of the most recorded bass players of all time!) - I’ll tell you all about it in this new lesson.</p>

<p>In this lesson I want to focus on a fast pentatonic type line I regularly play within my solos and fills.</p>
<p>Every time I use it within one of my videos I always get a heap of questions in the comments such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>What is that lick you played at... ?</li>
<li>How are you descending that fast?</li>
<li>How are you fingering it?</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I thought it'd be cool to break it down for you so you can finally see what I'm doing - and then get it into your vocabulary! ;)</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

<p>===</p>
<h1>Lesson Overview</h1>
<p>In this lesson Scott takes you through a Ferocious <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/jazz-lick-major-7th-type-chords-2.html" target="_blank">Major Lick</a> to really demonstrate how important and versatile the major scale is, especially when you get inventive with the intervals you use. The secondary focus of this lesson is on <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/developing-your-vocabulary-with-the-blues-scale.html" target="_blank">developing vocabulary</a> and this is definitely a great lick to get into your vocabulary!</p>
<p>Don’t worry if the lick Scott plays in this lesson is a bit beyond your ability right now, there's still a lot you can take away from this lesson. Scott shows you how to play the fundamental <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/bass-grooves-articulation.html" target="_blank">groove</a> which you can learn on its own. As well as this Scott demonstrates how he would approach breaking the lick down into small phrases so that you can really focus in on them and iron out any technique issues that may arise. From there you can take those bite sized chunks and slowly build up to playing the whole lick at <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/speed-bursts-bass-arpeggios-lesson.html">speed</a>. Then once you have the lick together you can add it into your own vocabulary and start using it in context.</p>
<p>If the lick is just outside your ability you may well surprise yourself by giving it a try! Using this approach of breaking lines down is a really great way to push yourself to try harder parts, that may usually be beyond your skill level, and really improve your playing.</p>
<p>The lick itself is constructed from almost entirely diatonic notes. A diatonic note is a note from within the scale. So in this instance the scale is C Major so the diatonic notes would be - C D E F G A B. The only acception to this is an Eb played at the begging of the lick which resolves (through a slide) to the major 3rd (E).</p>
<p>Scott also discusses how fundamental the major scale is to all other major harmony. In effect all the modes, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/gary-willis-style-pentatonic-lick.html" target="_blank">pentatonics</a> and <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/speed-bursts-bass-arpeggios-lesson.html" target="_blank">arpeggios</a> are built on the same notes that are used in the Major Scale. The only differences are the sequence in which the notes are played and, in the case of pentonics, that some notes are skipped.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the modes, check out Scott's "Discover the modes" mini course in the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/scotts-backstage-bonuses" target="_blank">SBL toolkit</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Your Homework</h1>
<p>Have you tried breaking the bass lines and licks you're trying to learn into smaller bite size phrases rather than attacking the whole thing at once?</p>
<p>Do you regularly learn new bass lines and licks that are slightly out of your comfort zone to help push your bass playing to the next level?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- See you all next week, Travis Moore - Academy Community Manager.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re anything like me, every now and again you just want to learn a good ol’ dirty sounding <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/riff-of-the-week/funk-soul-groove-bass-playing.html" target="_blank">groove</a> that makes you wanna say… <em>“Ooof”</em>…</p>
<p>Well if today is one of those day’s for you, you’re in the right place!</p>
<p>As well as teaching you a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/danny-mo-morris-r-b-bass-lesson.html" target="_blank">great bass line</a> that will make anyone in their right mind <em>get their groove on</em>, I’m also going to demonstrate a couple of great harmonic devices that you can use over static dominant chords immediately.</p>
<p>I wanna give you the <em>“Ooof factor”!</em></p>
<p>This groove is based around an E dominant 7th style vamp, and both of the licks include the minor 3rd. Now if you know anything about dominant <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/chords/playing-chords-on-bass-getting-your-voice-leading-together.html" target="_blank">chords</a> you’ll know that they are an extension of the major triad, i.e. the minor 3rd is essentially a wrong note - but, in this style of groove it still works! In fact it does more than work, it sounds fantastic and gives the bass line that real bluesy style sound.</p>
<p>I incorporate these types of lines and runs within my grooves as they’re a great way of expanding of the dominant 7th sound, and in-turn give you more options when grooving and soloing over static dominant chords.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You might of heard that "learning licks is bad"...</p>
<p>Well, let me squash that myth right now!</p>
<p>Learning licks is not only good... it's <em>essential</em> to your development as a bass player and musician.</p>
<p>Here's the deal...</p>
<p>No matter where you are in the world right now, when you were a child you were given the task of learning a language. We can all relate to this. As humans we need to communicate with each other - and language is our number one asset.</p>
<p>Whatever language we had to learn, we all started off by listening and then simply repeating what we had heard, until at around the age of 2-3 years old we had a pretty basic grasp of how to tell our parents that it was time to drop whatever they were doing, and take us to the nearest play-park... or at least that's what my son does ;)</p>
<p>There was no questions like <em>"are you talented enough to learn a language"</em>...</p>
<p>You just had to do it.</p>
<p>It's simply understood that children will repeat what they hear, and after certain amount of listening and repetition, they'll just 'get it'.</p>
<p>Learning bass, or any instrument is <em>exactly</em> the same.</p>
<p>You can learn all the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/mastering-your-bass-fingerboard.html" target="_blank">arpeggios</a>, all the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/major-scale-bass.html" target="_blank">scales</a>, all the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/slap-bass-lesson-the-sectret-triplet-technique.html" target="_blank">tricks</a>, have <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/string-crossing-exercise-bass-lesson.html" target="_blank">crazy technique</a>... but at the end of the day the absolute fundamentals are...</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen to great music that inspires you.</li>
<li>Imitate what you're hearing.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why if you're aiming to develop your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/soloing-lesson-bass-jazz-blues.html" target="_blank">soloing ability</a> on the bass -- learning licks is <em>so important</em>.</p>
<p>Without learning licks, you simply won't understand how a good solo line is constructed and applied over the different chord types. This is why it's vital that you learn what other soloists are playing and how they're approaching different chord progressions, so you can take what they're doing and absorb it into your own vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>So before we get into the lesson, I want to ask you...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What are you transcribing right now?</li>
<li>Who's language are you trying to recreate within your own bass playing?</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn't just how you learn to solo - <em>this is how you learn to play an instrument!</em></p>
<p>If you're not doing either of the above, <em>today</em> is the time to start!</p>
<p>Now, let's get into the lesson...</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to show you a great jazz style <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/bass-lick-vocabulary-workshop.html" target="_blank">lick</a> that can be used over any minor tonality... oh, and it's fierce! ;)</p>
<p>If this lick is above your skill level right now, don't sweat it! Just pick a simpler lick, riff or groove and work on that instead. The most important thing is that we're constantly developing our vocabulary by listening to and imitating other musicians.</p>
<p><em><strong>"But I don't want to sound like anyone else... I want to sound like me!"...</strong></em></p>
<p>I hear you, but don't worry. Yes, if you studied only one player you'd most likely end up sounding like them to some extent -- but if you study many different players, ultimately you will end up sounding like an amalgamation of them all. I am living proof of this - my main influences are Skuli Sverrission, James Jameson, Gary Willis, Pino Palladino and Kai Eckhardt... and yeah, I kinda sound like a weird mix of all of those guys moulded together.</p>
<p>So if you're wondering<em> "How do I develop my own voice and sound on the bass"</em>... well, this is it!</p>
<p>Who do you want to sound like a strange mix of?! Start learning their bass lines and licks - today.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<p>
<p>I get asked all the time... "is learning licks bad?"...</p>
<p>And I get it, I used to hear this all the time about certain players... <em>"he's just a lick player".</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, when people hear comments like this they automatically think that <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/stuck-in-one-area-of-the-fingerboard-watch-this.html" target="_blank">learning licks</a> is bad.</p>
<p>Well, that is a BIG mistake!</p>
<p>What many people forget is that learning <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/cool-bass-lick.html" target="_blank">licks</a> is VITAL to expanding your vocabulary on any instrument. Period.</p>
<p>Yes, you shouldn't '<em>just</em>' play licks - we need to develop our vocabulary in a way that gives us total freedom over the entire fingerboard. Yet it's important to understand that <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/awesome-chromatic-lick.html" target="_blank">learning licks</a> is a crucial element of expanding your vocabulary.</p>
<p>I should warn you - the lick I cover in this workshop is tough! But, the concepts I cover are applicable to anyone. Even if you've just been playing a few months, by simply watching this workshop you'll begin to understand what <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/ask-scott/building-bass-line-vocabulary.html" target="_blank">vocabulary</a> is, and how you're going to develop your own. So, even if this lick is way above your level - make sure you watch the entire tutorial as I cover some absolutely fundamental topics that will be important to your progression as a bass player and musician.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By the time my bass soloing had gotten to the point where I could easily move around the chord tones and chord scales pretty much all over the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/stuck-in-one-area-of-the-fingerboard-watch-this.html">fingerboard</a> with a decent amount of fluidity, I really started to take more and more interest in the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/how-to-play-out-when-soloing-on-bass.html">“out” sound</a> that so many great soloists use.</p>
<p>I started hearing it everywhere! Guitarists like Allan Holdsworth and John Scofield, bassists like Skuli Sverrision and Matt Garrison… these guys were using it all over the place within their solos, but I just couldn’t figure out how they were achieving these great out sounding lines.</p>
<p>So, I grabbed my bass and started to transcribe like crazy!</p>
<p>After a few weeks i’d started to figure out exactly how players were approaching the harmony and chords to get that <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/how-to-play-out-when-soloing-on-bass.html">"out" sound</a> I was chasing… but along the way, during my hours and hours of transcribing, I kept hearing a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/awesome-chromatic-lick.html">really cool lick</a> people were using over dominant chords. Obviously, I stole it straight away and it’s been in my soloing toolbox ever since ;)</p>
<p>Fast forward to just a few days ago... I was around at Geoff Chalmers’ house (the community manager within the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/sbl-insider-pro">SBL Academy</a>… and my bass geek buddy!) drinking coffee and jamming on our basses and I said<em> “hey Geoff, check out this <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/awesome-chromatic-lick.html">awesome lick</a>”… </em>I had my camera with me, so immediately we both said<em> “let’s get this down on camera so we can show the SBL posse!”</em>…</p>
<p>So, we grabbed the camera and I shot this short lesson so I could show you this cool lick I use.</p>
<p>If you hear some clanking noises… fear not, it was Geoff making his lunch in the background, lol!</p>
<p><strong>  Before you go and check out the lesson, I want you to do me a HUGE favour...</strong></p>
<p>I want you to leave a comment below and let me know if you enjoyed this style of “off the cuff” lesson. I’ve got a TON of extra stuff like this I could share with you… where I just grab the camera and hit record… no fancy lights or setup etc. Don’t worry though… i’ll always be releasing my slick fancy pants lessons with the cool production… I just want to know if you'd like some of these in the mix too.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed,</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WARNING!... In this bass lesson I'm going to show you a 'KILLER AWESOMESAUCE LICK' to demonstrate how to use the different fingerings of each arpeggio and how this will help you to play over the entire fingerboard... LIKE A BAD ASS!</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered how bass players such as Janek Gwizdala, Gary Willis, John Patitucci and Matt Garrison seem to be able to play bass lines and solos up and down the fingerboard seamlessly?</p>
<p>What's the secret?</p>
<p>They have amazing visualization of harmony on the fingerboard.</p>
<p>The key to mastering your visualization of the fingerboard is knowing three different <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/shape-shifting-chord-changes.html">shapes</a> for each of your fundamental arpeggios and then simply joining them together and playing 'through' the shapes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it can be hard for bass players to understand how to play 'through' the shapes and therefore they keep getting stuck in one area of the neck.</p>
<p>Let's get in the shed!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you've watched my lesson '<a title="Simple Shapes on the bass #2" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/shapes-on-bass-2.html">Using Simple Shapes on the Bass #2</a>', perhaps you remember that it dealt with those 'sexy notes' that have a special flavor to them, that kinda<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/beginners/bass-tip-2-ear-training.html"> surprise our ear</a>, but in a nice way, well... at least for most of us.</p>
<p>In this new bass lesson, I'm showing you a very simple bass lick that does exactly that: the reason why it sounds so good is that it adds an element of surprise --that will probably get you a lot of 'wows' by the way!</p>
<p>The surprise comes from the fact that it includes a lot of notes that don't 'fit' in the expected harmony: most of the notes are not directly related to the G minor chord that we're playing over. As a result, there's a 'tension and release' effect that makes us feel good. Well, check out for yourself! ;)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The legendary bass player Gary Willis is in my opinion one of the most unique bass players out there. He has his own unique approach to the bass guitar, not only in the way he plays but also his sound. He is one of the few bass players that is instantly recognizable when you hear him play.</p>
<p>I was actually lucky enough to study with Gary in Barcelona, and as you can imagine during that time I was 'Willis mad'... transcribing and absorbing everything I could get from him! Throughout all the transcribing and research I carried out, I quickly learned that Gary used the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/using-pentatonic-scales-1.html">pentatonic scale</a> extensively when soloing. In fact the pentatonic scale has a huge part to play in his instantly recognizable sound. Once I had made that discovery I spent several months weaving the pentatonic scale into my vocabulary so I would be able to access the same type of harmonic material he was using. At first I was using it on <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/solo-over-static-dominant-chords.html">static</a> grooves where a one chord vamp would last for an extended period of time, and then later on I was applying it to the jazz standard repertoire where I had to start dealing with multiple key centers and therefore multiple pentatonic scales throughout each piece.</p>
<p>In this tutorial I demonstrate a great lick that is based around the pentatonic scale and is very 'Willis' when played up to speed. It's simply a three note pattern moved throughout the scale. Take it slowly to start with, then start to <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/double-your-speed.html">crank up the speed</a> maybe 10bpm at a time until you reach a speed you're happy with and can play it comfortably.</p>
<p>Also take a look at</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this new bass lesson I'm going to show you a nice lydian jazz lick you can play over a Major 7th chord.</p>
<p>What's interesting about this one, is that there's a sharp 11th in it, which creates the "tension". If something makes you think of the Simpson's, that's because of this very tension note.</p>
<p>If you're not used to hearing 11th (or 4th) played over Major 7 chords, it will probably create… tension in your body, which is the point! But after a time, you'll get used to it and it should be a nice tension.</p>
<p>If you haven't watched my lesson <a title="How to Practice Arpeggios on the Bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">How to learn Arpeggios on the bass</a>, it might be a good idea to do so: in this lesson, I'm showing you how you should learn your arpeggios starting from different fingers --index, major and pinky. Here we're gonna use the "third position" (starting from the pinky).</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this new bass lesson, I'm taking you through a lick that we can play over an E minor 7th chord or over its relative major chord which is G Major 7th.</p>
<p>I'll be showing you what triads and <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">arpeggios</a> I'm using, so you're not only learning a new lick but you can also expand on that and build your own lines.</p>
<p>Remember that although learning a ton of licks is better than learning nothing ;), if you understand how a lick is built, you'll be much better equipped to create your owns and, more generally, you'll become a much better musician, not just a "<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/video-bass-lesson-ii-v-i-jazz-lick-2.html">lick player</a>".<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here's another bass lick you can play over major-7th type chords.The <a title="Jazz Lick for M7 Chords #1" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/licks/jazz-lick-major-7th-type-chords-1.html">previous one</a> was built mainly over the C major <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">arpeggio</a>. This one uses quite a few chromatic notes, for a change. Nothing really complicated but watch your fingering!</p>
<p>We'll learn this lick in B flat major but as always, don't hesitate to transpose it in other keys. Also, experiment and see how you could apply it, i.e. what you could play before and after and remember that these bass licks you learn are not supposed to be an end in themselves but rather to be a springboard.</p>
<p>So, again, you've got to understand how they're constructed so you can create your own, putting together various ideas and adding your personal touch / inspiration. Always look at the bigger picture.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you probably know by now, ScottsBassLessons is <em>not just</em> about licks, grooves and chops… What I'm striving to do here is to give you a 'non-reductive' approach to learning and playing the bass.</p>
<p>That said, I'm not '<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/video-bass-lesson-ii-v-i-jazz-lick-1.html">anti-lick</a>' at all! What I'm saying is that it's not <em>enough</em> to learn a ton of bass licks, particularly if you want to be able to play with other musicians. But learning bass licks and grooves is a part of your musical education and you'll benefit even more from learning if you understand how they are constructed, so you can create your owns.</p>
<p>So today I'm going to show you a simple jazz lick for <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/jazz-lick-major-7th-type-chords-1.html">Major 7th</a> type chords. It's built mainly over the C major arpeggio --btw. have you watched my lesson <a title="Practice Arpeggios on the Bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">practicing arpeggios on the bass</a>? When I say it's simple, I mean the way it's constructed is very simple, but make sure you use appropriate fingerings, by copying mine, for example. ;)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here's a new II-V-I bass lick in the key of Eb. Like in the previous lesson, we're gonna be playing the II-V within the first bar, instead of playing one chord per bar (or two bars for the root).</p>
<p>When you've got it under your fingers and you've practiced it in various keys, try to be inventive with the phrasing and the way you resolve!</p>
