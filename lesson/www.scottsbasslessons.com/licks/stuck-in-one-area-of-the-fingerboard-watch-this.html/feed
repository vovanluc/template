		<description><![CDATA[How do you shift vertically with speed and accuracy and still make the notes sound smooth?
For example. going from B flat to E flat and back or from C to F when playing eighth and sixteenth notes.  If you have a video can you tell me which one it is?
Thanks,   Rob]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott,


i love your bass lessons- Thanks so much for doing them!

What kind of strings do you use?  How much of a difference do strings make in your sound?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love your Work Scott!
In this exercise the most difficult part was putting the weight from the fourth finger to the second around the sixth position. I had to work hard to be accurate.

thx]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like that Scott always reminds us of where the chord notes are. Yes, we most likely know the names of the very middle of the fretboard, where we spend the most time. (Even so, some, like my friend David, play by ear alone and don&#039;t know the names of the notes.) And lots of us, thanks to Scott&#039;s lessons, are learning the rest of the fretboard in the best way possible, by actually using it learning the licks. Please keep doing what you are doing Scott. By all the comments, it&#039;s working splendidly!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott

Hope you&#039;re well. I&#039;ve been wrestling with this problem for longer than I want to admit. On and off but even so. Took this lesson last night and within 20 minutes of shedwork on it today, the fretboard just opened right up, even on the sharp and flat roots. It was incredible. Continued shedding it for another hour or so and everything just flowed easier than it ever has before. Thankyou so much again. The next band practice is going to be interesting!! And one question. Does Madrid feature anywhere in your gigging plans? Your 20 year beginner.]]></description>
