		<description><![CDATA[There are 16 notes in the lick (A full bar of 16th notes), with the last note being the high G, and then the grove starts again on the low G on the 1 of the next bar. Hope that helps in some way!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[HI Scott
This one is wonderful, and I can play it pretty ok to my standards, but you got to help me out. The lick takes 18 notes. You start on 1, and you end on 1. How does that add up? I alway end up shorten it and add something else adding up to 1 bar, which is OK, I just hate it when I can&#039;t figure it out!! Also the groove is easy (on the paper), but you seem to float quite a bit, which gives it all the charm, but pretty hard for me to dig.
Been playing bass for the last 25 years, but since I found your site, I have improved like never before - cheers mate]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As I was listening to the &quot;out&quot; examples I was reminded of the book by Slonimsky, Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns, [http://bit.ly/YLi8KB] that Coltrane used to study out of. Any chance you might venture down that road some day? It would be great to have a coach/ally enhance the parts of music theory that I missed out on.
Cheers,

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Nice LICK!
Scott is there any chance you make a basic tutorial on Equalizing? From the several videos you&#039;ve uploaded i could recognize farily different tones with that same bass and it just cought my eye (or should i say ear?) since im not able to really shape the tone as precisely as i would like. Love that Gary Willis tone you get out of that bass.]]></description>
