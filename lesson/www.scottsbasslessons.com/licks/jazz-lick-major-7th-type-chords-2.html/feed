		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott, I´d like to thank you for putting this material online for free, I have been learning a lot about music with you as great teacher, great musician and a excellent person. By the way I found that &quot;Jazz Lick for Minor-7th Type Chords #1&quot; is the same video as &quot;Home / Jazz Lick for Major-7th Type Chords #2
&quot; if you could fix it would be awesome. One more time I thank you for doing what you are doing not only to the bass community but also to constantly contributing to music in general. Big thanks and keep the awesome work. Cheers
