		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott, Would you suggest a cool wall poster bass chart please. I have been playing for many years and every once in awhile I get lazy...Just once in awhile mind you. So it would come in handy. So thanks ahead of time. I might add as well as being a cool bass player, you were &quot;blessed&quot; to be an awesome teacher. We are all better for it. Thanks again. Doc, player and custom builder in Morro Bay, Ca. USA]]></description>
