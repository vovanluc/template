Great tutorial with a lot of good advice within it. I especially agree with the last bit about improvement being a gradual process, as opposed to everyone expecting instant results. </p>

Thanks &#8211; Mark F.</p>

I&#8217;m 70 next summer, and I probably haven&#8217;t got the 10&#8242; hours. However, started to play 5 years ago, formed a band with friends and had the intuition to practicing scales and arpeggios in order to reach a &#8220;playable level&#8221;. And found it amazingly fun &#8211; for a while. This tutorial now got me motivated to practice more &#8211; and more systematically &#8211; to reach the next level. Thanks for a great tutorial. I am certainly going to look for more on your website. BR Rupert.</p>

Your totally right&#8230; be systematic&#8230; if you were building a house you&#8217;d have to be systematic about it. View your playing in the same way&#8230; you&#8217;ve got a goal (for instance building a house or in your case becoming a better player). To build a house you have to get the foundations right first, then you build on the foundations brick by brick until finally after some hard work you have a shiny big mansion! piece a cake!<br />

If your struggling for time, practice the essentials &#8211; learn your chord tones as well as possible, transcribe when you can, learn about theory/harmony and how to apply it to the bass. &#8211; Maybe try just doing scales and arpeggios for 30 mins and then 30 mins of playing. Then just transcribe when you can. </p>
<p>Or&#8230; you can do what I used to do and either get up a 5am everyday so I could do 3 hours before work. Or, I once turned my life back to front lol&#8230; Because of distractions during the day, I thought it was a great idea to sleep all day, then practice all night&#8230; I did it for about 6 weeks&#8230; it was a bad idea and turned me into a social recluse lol!</p>
<p>Thanks for checking the site out Ed, hope your enjoying it.<br />

Although I&#8217;ve always loved being a night owl and love practicing/working at night I&#8217;m starting to believe that it&#8217;s far more productive to practice first thing in the morning. Now that I&#8217;ve got a four year old kid that would mean a 5am for me!!! Very doubtful I can do that. We&#8217;ll see&#8230; :)</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-860" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Great tutorial Scott, and a bit of the kick up the butt for me. I only have an hour about 4 times a week due to life, though I have been playing for about 12 years, and have probably plateued for the last 3 :(. Lately I&#8217;ve been trying to combine areas of practice. I&#8217;m studying/transcribing Walking Bass Lines using different techniques of leading notes, so Scale wise, chromatic, Arpeggio, fumbling. It really hurts my head though&#8230;and is definatly not consistent. Must make more effort!<br />
Really enjoying your lessons.</p>

Keep practicing the foundation stuff (arpeggios/chord tones etc) and you&#8217;ll end up with a really strong harmonic foundation on the bass. Then when it comes time to start doing more complex things you&#8217;ll find it SO much easier. Keep at it and you&#8217;ll get there! Ez. Scott.</p>

I plan to donate some $$ in the near future once my student loans come in (educational purposes). I have been working an hour a day recently on scales/arpeggios but I had a couple things I wanted to ask you.</p>
<p>1) Should I pick a key and work through all the modes in that key before moving on? </p>
<p>2) Should I practice an arpeggio that falls under my scale practice for the day? </p>
<p>  The fact that there are 12 keys scares me because it means there is that much more i have to learn. I was also considering practicing a scale/arpeggio that are related through the circle of fifths to get started on that thing. Any further advice is much appreciated!!</p>

<p>The first question&#8230; If you don&#8217;t want to be so regimented thats totally fine. Experiment your self and see which suits you better&#8230; whatever you do though just make sure you&#8217;re being thorough. </p>
<p>The circle of fifths exercise is a great one!</p>

You have inspired me more then you know. Thanks Scott!</p>

Each person is a person and things work diferent to each, that way will be my way and it&#8217;s ok. Read comments like the comment of Sir. Ruppert made me to understand this.<br />
I will start my studies in university in the next week and I&#8217;m preparing my body and mind to wake up one hour &#8211; maybe two &#8211;  before to get the practice in day.<br />

<p>Great advise. For the most part I have been doing what you said in the video, but I have not been timing myself. Recently I have been practicing my scales a lot. I don&#8217;t really know them by heart so my goal is to know all the major/minor scales on the bass from memory, then move into the arpeggios&#8230;etc. Thanks for the advise, you gave me a better direction to move forward with in my practice.</p>

<p>thankyou very much for the incredible amount of invaluable information i have learned from this site. </p>
<p>i plan to study paul chambers and ray brown in exactly the same transcribing way that you just taught me. but i have a 2 problems&#8230;</p>
<p>im not sure what recordings to get in order to start easy and work my way up to more difficult transcriptions.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>i have no idea how to get the corresponding lead sheets. they just dont seem to be on the net and my local music store doesent stock them.</p>
<p>any help would be much appreciated.</p>

There should be what you need in there. I&#8217;m pretty positive you can get them on Amazon if you have a look. They&#8217;re an amazing resource of lead sheets to all the jazz standards. As far as recordings go&#8230; I&#8217;d just check out some simple jazz standards and then try and find corresponding recording of the bassists you mentioned&#8230; if you do a search on google loads of stuff will come up. For instance you could find a lead sheet of Milestones, then find a recording of Paul Chambers playing it. </p>
<p>Thanks for checking out the site Ste! Ez, Scott.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m 21 yrs old now and I am just in this impass about what is going to be my go, acctually i&#8217;m studying law in a university but not too sure about that ¬¬.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been playing since my 14 and I love to play bass, never wanted guitars or something like that, maybe drums cause of rhythm but this video was really helpfull, such nice words, congrats!</p>
<p>Btw abou the pratice, Eric Clapton said too that from his 17 up to 21 its was the time that he decided to improve his way of playing to become the guitar player he wanted to be, praticing like all day long and learning from the records he geted from Jonh Mayall (and The Blues Makers), that writer is right and you too.</p>
<p>But well, I&#8217;ll definitely gonna set my schedules and pratice more to become the bass player I want to be.</p>
<p>Thanks man.</p>
<p>Have a good week.</p>

Also it is very interesting what you say about that all reduces to the amount of hours you put into the thing you do, in this case, bass.<br />
I wonder why i cant see other people&#8217;s comments?<br />
Anyways, already putting together a schedule that works for my times.<br />
Thank you scott!, you are just great.<br />

It is so important to hear from a teach that YOU can do it&#8230; I know what I&#8217;m talking about, since my first teacher told me he had overestimated my capacities, and that kept me away from my base several months, cause he is a very good musician and I thought *he&#8217;s right, he knows what he is talking about&#8221;.<br />
Almost a year after that I decided to retake the playing and I found a really good teacher. So after just 8 months of daily practicing and good lessons I&#8217;m breaking into that &#8220;jump&#8221; you&#8217;re talking about. I can really feel it. I really think talent exists. There are people more talented to certain things that others, but talent needs practice, without it, talent is dead. Thanks again and keep being like that, you&#8217;re great :)</p>

I have been playing since I was 12 (I&#8217;m 54), and I use to practice 8-10 hours a day, when I was a youngster&#8230;I broke down my practice time exactly the way you discuss&#8230;.I saw great improvement..Then, life took over..<br />
I would love to practice three hours a day, but I have a day job, and also need to spend some time excersising as well ( a hour or so).<br />
I have definitely &#8220;hit the wall&#8221; with my playing&#8230;everything feels redundant. If I could only really commit two hours a day to practicing, what type of regimen would you recommend?<br />
Your videos are the best lessons I have found on the web&#8230;you&#8217;re a great communicator, and I would love to take one-on-one lessons via the web, if that is something you offer.</p>

As in, if you want to practice scales for say an hour, maybe just do half an hour instead and so on. The key is to keep the structure within your practice time and don&#8217;t fall into just widdling around for two hours. Piece a cake! S</p>

Usually punch out maybe 6 plus  hours on a weekend as well.  Just want to get as far as I can and play the Bass well :-)</p>

Where many have failed and I could simply not grasp the concepts until I watched your videos. Ive been playing for some 30 years now but scales still mystified me. Ive had tutors over the years but became quickly disenchanted after a few lessons. Seemed it was money spent on that hour to watch someone demonstrate their skills instead of helping me to improve mine. I&#8217;m not strictly a bass player, I play just about everything, but your lessons do apply across the board.</p>

Truly amazing to say the least.  Simple concepts, minimal effort to grasp, and a lot of encouragement to practice.  It doesn&#8217;t get any better than this!  Thanks Scott!</p>

Thanks for this video, I am 58 and played just a little bass when I was 19 most of which I have forgotten. My son is a drummer and teacher has lent me a bass and practice amp very kindly. I am now 58 and still obsessed by music, so here we go to try and learn to play bass! Your tutorials on line make good sense whilst being nice and relaxed to follow.<br />

<p>thank you for your giving in time and knowledge. I will be tuned into you for a very long time after seeing this video and hitting a plato for a long while now. you have taught me a few things that i have been missing and in not only how much to practice but what to practice&#8230;..thank you greatly.

I have read that you need to do something consistently for 30 days before it becomes a habit.<br />

I can see ti would better to see how the bass part relates to the chord progressions.  I really love<br />

I am an older guy maybe like Butch that played when I was young and always wanted to be a musician but life kinda got in the way with kids and working&#8230;probably a story you have heard before. I am now retired and still enjoy the bass. I still get asked to play out a little but I always shy away from solos and such&#8230;now that I have the time I can dedicate myself to playing,,,it beats feeding the pigeons and I figure if nothing else will hopefully keep my brain sharp. As many have said thanks again for freely sharing your knowledge!!!<br />
If I could have had a teacher like you when I was young who knows where I could have gone&#8230;</p>

I find it interesting that, after all I&#8217;ve read, seminars that I&#8217;ve attended and professional musicians that I&#8217;ve worked with over the years, your approach clearly states how to reach the success that most musicians desire.  Many thanks for your sharing and great instruction, Scott!</p>

Amazing tutorial, thank you for your inspiration. This tutorial, considered together with your video called &#8220;The Most Important Bass Lesson I Ever Teach&#8221; are the best things I could get from web regarding training materials. Congratulations for your teaching effort! This tutorial is pretty much aligned with an equivalent content I found on No Treble website: <a href="http://www.notreble.com/buzz/2010/02/11/efficient-20-minute-practice/" rel="nofollow">http://www.notreble.com/buzz/2010/02/11/efficient-20-minute-practice/</a><br />
Not just 20 minute, not possible 3 hours&#8230; find the mid term and go for meet the goal stablished by yourself! That´s my thinking. It´s not easy, but nobody told that would be&#8230; I´m beginner and build the foundation can not be the most fun thing to do, but it´s necessary. Try to organize yourself and have focus are great part of any well done activity on our lives. Like you, I´m have difficult to keep focused in a specific activity or personal project. You really bet, man. Cheers from São Paulo, Brazil.</p>

<p>Just receintly signed up to your email lessons.  I&#8217;ve been following you for about a year on-line and  I dig your teaching style.  Your lessons are interesting and they&#8217;re easy to follow.<br />
I think your idea of practicing three hours a day is right on.  I usually practice a couple hours every other day.  After checking out you emailed lesson today about Practicing Three Hours A Day, I realize I need to practice more.  So I&#8217;ll adjust my practice time. I know I&#8217;ll be a better Bass Player following your information. Thanks for the great lessons, Consider me Another Loyal Fan.</p>

Started when I was 15 and I am now 45. I&#8217;ve played in bands professionally for many years. Never llearned music properly. It was really tough for me at many times because I wanted to do so many things on bass but did not have the technic&#8230;. Well to make a long story short. It is now that I have this desire to advance, if you will, in music. This tutorial really gave me some perspective on how to approach practicing the bass. did not have a clue how!!! LOL</p>

I´m 39, and trying to play bass for almost 20 years. That means i can play some stuff, but the tunes i always considered amazing or to play melodic bass lines i can´t, and the reason for this you put it in very simple words: hard work and dedication. We human beings want to take all for granted, and don´t think that everything has it´s own pace, it´s moment and time, and if we want to be something we admire we have to put effort and time, and not to despair if we don´t see the results right away; nothing comes the easy way.<br />
Thanks for sharing that information with  us!!</p>

<p>Thanks for these tutorials in such relaxed and friendly way, they are inspiring me and keeping me going, now that I&#8217;ve got a bass guitar and all the material I needed to re-approach the bass playing again after some years of a 1st interest back in the 90&#8217;s, which was replaced by the accordion at that time, but what has to be , really ends up happening  and recently I felt like to dedicate to this seriously, slowly but steady, after have moved to Southport and needing to overcome personal issues, maybe now I feel more mature and available to take the time and do something that i really wanted, without any rush. I came across your videos on Youtube and they shown me how calmly approach to the bass playing and although in the beginning I was struggling to understand the general concept of what this is about , now i got the idea that as part of the rhythm section and harmony, we use patterns (originated by the scales principles and chord rules) , and can even be more creative and complete if we learn more information about music theory. I am still on the scales and chords practicing , very beginner but I am picking the idea of bass lines to keep me motivated and I will do serious study too at same time, to evolve&#8230;Your schedule feels very right even for a beginner like me.  I am very happy for watching your exclusive tutorials and grateful for being sent them.  Thanks, you are doing a unique, amazing job :)</p>

<p> Thanks so much for the lessons. Just started checking them out, but so far they are very well done.</p>
<p> I am coming back to bass after quite a few years of performing as a singer/songwriter/guitarist. I am looking to fill in the gaps financially with bass gigs. Definitely a shortage of good players in most places that I&#8217;ve lived.</p>
<p> A couple of comments on practicing:</p>
<p>&#8211; There is certainly a baseline amount of time that you simply must have your hands on the bass for the sake of muscle memory and to stay sharp (maybe 30 min 5 x per week for me), but it is important that beyond that amount quality and concentration during the time one does have will trump the practice all day while your mind wanders method.</p>
<p>-I notice than when trying to grasp a new concept or technique, that the initial attempt to &#8216;get it&#8217; takes more time, but after that it takes very little time each practice session to etch it in my mind and fingers.</p>
<p>-I also realize that much of the time I would call a plateu was really from practicing the same stuff I knew rather than moving along to something new. Plateaus are a fact, but we often love to admire what we can already do that it takes us getting bored or frusterated to move on to new things.</p>
<p>-Lastly, playing with others is what will make you realize that the practice is worthwhile or make you realize you need more of it. </p>
<p>I spent a few month of only playing bass for about 3 hours a day and was starting to think I was wasting my time until I got together with a very good drummer and guitarist and realized that I was able to keep up where I couldn&#8217;t have before that spurt of practicing.</p>
<p>Anyway&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;thanks again.</p>

I picked up the bass about eleven years ago after a few frustrating years of practicing electric guitar. Well, picked up the bass, turned on Nantucket Sleigh Ride from Mountain, and learned it note for note. Practicing scales on electric guitar payed off, and I found I loved the bass and preferred playing it more than electric guitar.  Been on and off with the bass though for years,as I raised my daughters  and all and didn&#8217;t have much time in the day. They are grown now and I have time to get into it again and  I have to say, this must be perfect timing Scott, as I found you on the web searching for tips on how to play walking bass lines, and found your clips  totally inspirational, the way you explain and other clips that you demonstrate, absolutely awesome, and this tutorial helps puts one and one together when it comes to practicing. Can&#8217;t thank you enough. 1st hour arpeggio&#8217;s, 2nd and 3rd hour transcribe, listen and learn songs. Love it! I am a devotee of yours for the next few years or so.</p>

<p>Awesome video, I&#8217;ve been playing for about a month or so. I went to YouTube to help myself learn and it gave me crap until I came across your video&#8217;s. You have inspired me to dig deep and never back down from a good challenge. Anyways I really don&#8217;t have much time to practice that much. I&#8217;m 27, work nights and have kids so I find it hard to practice or make a schedule. I don&#8217;t even know how to begin a scale or an arpeggio( I think that&#8217;s spelled) or haven&#8217;t been able to see the tabs for them. So what advise would you give me to help me out? Thank you and I think you are awesome man!!!</p>

<p>Thanks so much for the walking bass series. It&#8217;s truly an inspiration. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been playing bass on and off for a long time. I learned on an upright in the 60&#8217;s when electric basses were fairly new. When I bought a Fender Precision, which I still have, I remember having to prop it up on a bar stool, because I  wasn&#8217;t able to play  &#8220;sideways&#8221; I managed to defeat that problem but I still use classical fingering, struggling through scales three frets at a time. </p>
<p>I have the time and if the Beetles could put in 8 hours a night 7 days a week I think I should be able commit to three hours a day. Imagine being able to play a 1- 3 -5 chord without having to shift! </p>
<p>Keep up the good work and thank you again<br />
Bob</p>

Also, why do you play fretted basses more? I&#8217;m curious if you have a preference between fretted &amp; fretless and why. Thanks</p>

<p>Thank you for offering a very common sense method to learning a new instrument. I switched from guitar to bass about a month ago, and enjoyed playing this last month more than the last few years of playing guitar. I really appreciate your approach to getting the fundamentals down for a solid foundation with the bass, as I realized quickly that I needed to unlearn some habits I developed with the guitar which just don&#8217;t work on the bass.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br />

<p>I&#8217;ll be starting my university studies in order to get a bachelors in &#8220;Contemporary Composition&#8221; on March and the last couple of months I have only been practicing about and hour or so per day, not because I am busy or anything but rather because I get easily distracted (as you pointed out). This video gave me the pep talk I needed in order to get back to practicing my 3 daily hours. And I specially like the bit about practicing for 10,000 hours before becoming world class.</p>
<p>Anyways, I hope you keep up your great videos.<br />
Thanks again.</p>

<p>Great advice about practising and I totally believe it is the way forward. One question about practising within this framework:</p>
<p>I used practice a series of grooves when I was younger from the books, Bass Bible and Funk Bass. I used to practice to a schedule and make notes of my progress. However, the problem I had back then (some 15 years ago!), which I&#8217;m still not sure what the answer is today, is when to move on. For example I would get to a reasonable tempo on a groove and move on to the next one. Each practice session I would revisit previous grooves to make sure I could still play them. As time when on, I was obviously spending more and more time reviewing my old stuff and not as much on new stuff.</p>
<p>I must have felt I needed to keep fresh with the old stuff as well as the new. But I guess there comes a point where you leave the old stuff behind? Does anyone have any thoughts?</p>

Your tutorials have been a revelation- I may never be particularly  good, but I am making progress, better posture and fingering, and even the simple bass lines I&#8217;m playing are sounding better.</p>

<p>I have playrd in a few bands over the last 30 years. I am looking to improve again and found your site . You have given me the tools and inspiration to start practicing again. I have learned most of the songs we play originally from records&#8230; now the internet has made things much easier. I am looking forward to learning how to practice for solos and fills. I think I have found the right site!  Thanks!</p>

thanks heaps for this video! This hit me heaps good because im exactly whats happening in this video&#8230; iv been playing bass since i was 16 but i only ever played riffs and all my favorite songs. but now im 21 years old and starting to take things seriously, got private bass lessons and everything. My only problem is i work full time so all i have is 2-3 hours to practice at 10pm-midnight/1am so i started stressing/getting depressed because i thought i wouldn&#8217;t get anywhere in life doing that&#8230; and you made me feel better so thank you :)<br />
i have a question but&#8230; iv never played in a band ever, is this a bad thing? and if it isn&#8217;t is it ok that i don&#8217;t join or play in a band for my first year of intents study (getting grade 1 in bass playing) because people say you learn faster in a band but im to self conscious about joining a band because i know my timing sucks and i can&#8217;t feel the pulse most the time (which is why im getting lessons etc) </p>
<p>Cheers,<br />

If you stick to that 5 days a week you&#8217;ll be killing it! The band thing &#8211; yeah, you do tend to learn faster when putting what you&#8217;re practicing into practice if you know what I mean. If I where you I&#8217;d try and hook up with some guys to jam with. Here&#8217;s the thing &#8211; you&#8217;ve got to be chilled about it &#8211; if you feel self conscious about it, get rid of it! Don&#8217;t let that keep you from progressing. I put myself under huge pressure sometimes, and in situations I don&#8217;t feel very comfortable in &#8211; but &#8211; it&#8217;s good for me&#8230; I have to grab the reigns of my own destiny and make sure FEAR is not ruling me. If you&#8217;re timing sucks &#8211; well it&#8217;ll get better every time you play ;) Good luck on your journey Mark! Scott ;)</p>

You really explain everything in a really clear, optimistic and motivating manner. I&#8217;m actually not a bass player, I&#8217;m a guitarist, but I&#8217;ve found plenty of useful things here like scale and arpeggio practice. I&#8217;ve started to build my own schedule for practice. Though I&#8217;ve found myself&#8230;kinda stuck in transcribing. Like I&#8217;ve got some interesting solo and I start to learn it, look what scale is used, positions and all, but at the end of a day I just learn how to play a solo (or not, lol) without clear comprehension of it. I thought may be you can do some tutorial about transcribing?<br />
But anyway, thanks for the amazing videos Scott!</p>

I mean, in a &#8220;couple&#8221; of minutes you just grasped loads of important stuff, not only for bass playing, but for other things in life. Not looking for results all the time and being consistent in training and hard work is just&#8230; well&#8230;being in the moment and striving moment after moment, letting thing flow just &#8220;building up&#8221; inside.<br />

As strange as it sounds I had a similar start to you with bass, I started playing at around 18 and then joined a band for a year gigging and some recording but nothing too major and I always worry that now i&#8217;m in my 20&#8217;s and studying fulltime at university and see people on youtube who are alot younger and alot better at playing that I&#8217;ve almost missed out my chance to actually achieve my goals with bass of being a competent player and hearing how your story unfolded is a real boost to my confidence. :D</p>
<p>Plus another good tip apart from using Scott&#8217;s lesson is &#8216;Bass Guitar Exercises for Dummies&#8217; I recently bought this book as I wanted to have a book that contained all the scale patterns I had them all in one place and it&#8217;s helped alot. I wouldn&#8217;t take the book and read it cover to back as that is not its aim, but take what you want, right now with Scotts advice in this video i&#8217;m practicing modes of scales and arpeggios :D</p>
<p>Once again, thanks Scott for another awesome video, rock on dude.</p>

A couple questions for you: 1: do you practice with a metronome? 2: although I realize I need to practice scales and arpeggios, my biggest problem while playjng is trying to get back to the &#8220;1&#8221; or root after I play a fill. Should I practice getting back to the one or should I practice scales and arpeggios and getting back to the one will come eventually? Great videos. Thanks for your unselfishlessness.<br />

<p>So I started to make a &#8216;bass diary&#8217;. After I practiced I wrote down what I&#8217;ve played, what I&#8217;ve practiced. Things that went well, things that were awful and needed some more practicing. I also rated my playing. 1 was worthless, 10 was amazing! It&#8217;s madness. But when I wrote down the things that didn&#8217;t went well I knew exactly what to practice again and again. I was pretty busy that time so I had to write those things down because otherwise those things slipped my mind.</p>

<p>You have got to be the first person on the intent who didn&#8217;t use the term &#8220;ya know&#8221; inside an interview like situation! Thank you! My guess is that you learned your public speaking skills exceedingly well and would excel at any speaking venue activities.</p>
<p>To be frank, It was indeed a pleasure to just sit here and listen to you like we were having a conversation rather than a &#8220;lesson&#8221;.</p>
<p>Thank you &#8230;</p>
<p>Once again, brilliant, well spoken and produced, and thanks!</p>

<p>Great video and it has really encouraged me to be a better bass player as i&#8217;m just starting out and aiming to take this serious as a musician. Drums is my first instrument so learning to play the bass is a big eye opener for me. </p>
<p>Just a quick question: Is there any particular website that you use to find transcriptions/lead sheets and also play-along tracks too? </p>

The problem is I&#8217;ve just played for a couple of months and I have a lot to practice just that<br />
I don&#8217;t know what I should practice, I&#8217;ve learnt almost nothing theoretical(apart from tones)<br />
and I know just a few scales, as you said the Internet gave me too much info, but do you<br />
have any tips on what I should practice? I want to learn scales and arpeggios but mostly I<br />
don&#8217;t get the lingo.<br />

<p>I know you are right because I had the same feeling 1 month ago after a gig.  (that I was not good enough). I have played a lot but always the same things.<br />
So I start to practise the arpeggios, and yes, that&#8217;s boring.<br />
I was just wondering how to practise and mix with other work to make it more fun. You answered. Thanks for those advices.<br />
I &#8216;m not sure to find 3 hours a day. I will start with 2 but keep the 3 parts scales/arpeggios/Transcribe/Play.<br />
Thanks again.<br />

I learn playing bass by myself since 5 years, helping me with a bass method (wrote by Francis Darizcuren a french bass player), and i though that i don&#8217;t do any progress since a moment. But your videos really help me to playing better and give me the impression that i really progress day after day, and have more fun playing my bass !

You are a great communicator and motivator.  I feel like I have a personal teacher.  I&#8217;ve started bass lessons to help me on my way to playing six bass steel drums.  I&#8217;ve been playing guitar pans, double guitar and am now starting four cello&#8230;getting into bass lines.  Your advice for practice will help me stay focused, if I can stick to a schedule.</p>

<p>Thanks very much for that. All stuff that I needed to hear. I too have had gigs in bands in the past which I didn&#8217;t necessarily deserve yet. I have practiced my scales, major modes, and arpeggios a lot, but was never able to see how it all applied to my playing. But your youtube lessons are bridging the gap for me. So thank you very much. I really appreciate it.</p>

<p>Thanks for this great video on your approach to practicing!  I&#8217;m not at all sure why but I find I have the same susceptibleness of getting distracted with other things as you have although I haven&#8217;t gotten on top of it like you have.  We seem similar in the same ways you mentioned in your video and although I know it doesn&#8217;t make us the same as each other in every way because so much more goes into the making of each individual, it is nonetheless encouraging for me to hear and personally relate to what you are saying. It also made me smile because I know that in my studio with its fiber optic connection to the internet, I can go &#8220;down the rabbit hole of distraction&#8221; faster than most and with the amount of time I spend in my studio, probably way more often than most too!</p>
<p>I know that consistency is key and in order to get to the next level it requires, as you point out, being dedicated, armed with a rigid practice schedule that has at its heart, daily consistency, divided into timed sections of focus on a particular area. </p>
<p>I really liked your insight about not getting hung up on measuring progress; since progress in getting better on my instrument is not linear, and is more akin to periodic steps punctuated by Aha! moments of insight, then constant measuring of my progress will result more often than not, in disappointment.</p>
<p>So it was really great to be reminded of what I need to do and also to take the long view of the journey to getting to that next level. Your video has reinvigorated my approach to practice. </p>
<p>Thanks!<br />
Andrew.</p>

However, I feel like a total beginner when I watch some of these videos. I don&#8217;t have the money for formal traing nor do I have 3 hours a day (I have 4 kids).

I don&#8217;t know arpegios, I am just now starting to focus on learning scales, and transcription is out of the question for now. I have a pretty good ear for music but have never put the time into actually learning to play the bass well. I can play, but I can&#8217;t play well. I have recently made the comitment to practice daily (about 1 hour a day), which leads me to this question&#8230;.for someone at my skill level, what would you recomend practicing? Would you focus on scales more as a &#8220;beginner&#8221;? Do you have any lessons that would be better for people like me? I feel like I might not be your ideal student as most of the lessons you have are fairly advanced for me. Maybe there is a website that is more suited to my needs. </p>
<p>Thanks for all your hard work. Truly inspirational and informative. </p>
<p>Kevin</p>

After leaving this message I found that you do in fact have lessons that are at my skill level. I wonder if you have ever thought about catagorizing your videos a bit more to they are easier to find. Perhaps list them according to skill level, or having a section for beginers, intermediate, and advanced.<br />
I hope to really improve my playing through your tutorials. I am going to take the long road and just start from the begining. After I get a grasp on the major scales, what wold you recomend moving on to?</p>

<p>Once again, great information right when I needed it. You have a great mindset for this teaching thing as well as playing. You are probably approaching the 10,000 hours of teaching soon if not already. You really enjoy what you&#8217;re doing, that is obvious. Thank you for your time and energy. </p>

It&#8217;s maybe the most important lesson one needs to always keep in mind.<br />
I had my son listen to it several times, in order to (hopefully) make him understand he won&#8217;t have Zack Wilde&#8217;s (his favorite guitarist) skills after only 6 months of studying and practicing&#8230; he must be consistent  and don&#8217;t expect the skills to land from nowhere&#8230;<br />
I always stress out that in order for one to become a professional musician (or anything), he need 1% of talent and 99% of hard work! </p>
<p>Since I first saw this lesson a few months back, I took your advice and scheduled my practicing on the Bass &#8211; and it really does wonders! </p>
<p>Thanks, man. </p>

<p>Thanks for this brilliant video (and you site overall). It&#8217;s been years I&#8217;m trying to *really* improve, years I always find something else to do to avoid working the basics (despite me knowing how important it is).<br />
I fell now &#8220;less alone&#8221; to hear that you had the same issue indeed ;)</p>
<p>Now, I don;t have 3h a day to train my bass skills BUT your training program is easy enough to scale down and I have started to plan accordingly, if i can stick to it, I do expect some huge improvements.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for this lesson.. it does unlock a lot a stupid &#8220;locks&#8221; in the training process&#8230;<br />
Cheers,<br />

Touring all over the place with musicians (in hindsight) way better than me. If truth be told I thought I was hot sh*t. But I wasn&#8217;t. I was barely making it and when the phone stopped ringing it hit me that I couldn&#8217;t just blag it anymore. I&#8217;ve always wanted to be good at this since I was old enough to know what the bass guitar was and I&#8217;ve started relearning the instrument properly this time with your help. Thanks a million.</p>

I just want to let you know how much I appreciate your videos,<br />
all of your lessons offer the best information and cover alot of questions without them having to be asked.<br />
over the last couple years Id gone through a good number of youtube tutorial vids an have found that of all of em I resonate with your the most. This video in particular has offered me alot of hope as well.<br />
Knowing you started at 18 shows me just how much can be accomplished, I myself began playing at 20 and thats when I realized, yes this is what I want to do. Im 24 now and have come a long way.<br />
Latley Id been letting myself get down about other younger and better players but truth be told thats just not important to my journey :)<br />
This video really drives that home for me, as well as the importance of consistent practice.<br />
up until this point my practice schedule has been play a bunch of stuff at home, then go hang out with musicians who are better and jam with their stuff, (not many bass players around where I am so there happy to have me :P) but really, its time to get serious!<br />
Thanks again scott<br />
what you do here means ALOT to me</p>

<p>a while ago, i decided to act upon the idea that i wanted to play Bass, and ordered one. i always liked the instrument, but i recently started thinking in a different way, and one thought was that i saw myself with that instrument and felt a connection with how well it translates the music, and i know i can succeed. i FEEL and know that this is for me.</p>
<p>part of how i&#8217;m planning to start was mainly about practice and easy steps, and how i want to get to know my bass and feel it.. everything has its moment, from the time ill touch my bass until i form a habit of transcending while playing, and i really appreciate you being part of this</p>
<p>everything you say has a deep meaning and translates your ideas fluently, i thank you again Scott, you are a true brother</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-10027" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>What I really like about these lessons is the advice that you give that doesn&#8217;t go solely around what to play and various techniques.  Other online instructors will give you lessons only about scales and styles, but they don&#8217;t give any sort of advice when it comes down to progress.  Even in their beginner videos they won&#8217;t give advice like this on how to practice, instead they just spout out material.  However Scott, your advice transcends past just bass lessons and a lot of these videos can be applied to other instruments, and really to life in general.  I really appreciate this and I think you for it.</p>

You correctly define the choice one has between becoming a great player like you, or having a life! 3 hours a day? Minimum! Don&#8217;t you realize that slobs like me (and 90% of the rest of society) find it difficult to do anything for 3 hours at a time, even watching TV.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll keep trying though.</p>
<p>Just a thought &#8211; if I practice for 1 hour  a day will I become one third as good as you, because that would do me!</p>

I started playing Bass back around 2008 . By 2009 I had lost interest . Life just got in the way . A few weeks ago , My love for the Bass rekindled . Im back practicing again and your vidieo&#8217;s inspire me to want to become a better player . I am at this time practicing around two hrs. in the evening so far every week night and on the weekends on my days off I feel I just need to cut loose of the same &#8221; Do re, me &#8221; all week long just doesn&#8217;t cut it . No fun &amp; Roy becomes a dull boy&#8230;LOL ! So with the help of a  Beer &amp; a shot :) ..I love to listen to some classic Rock like Led Zeppelin and emulate what I&#8217;m hearing . I find that a lot of times I can play along much more efficiantly sometimes just by listening . Then by late Sunday evening , or first thing on Monday evening its back to the Boring basics again..LOL ! Not sure if you would agree with my approach but Im the type of person that needs to keep it fun . This time ..No damn surrender !! Thanks for all your help and providing a great service to the cause..Cheers from here in the USA&#8230;:)</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-10450" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&#8217;ve been subscribed to your youtube channel for quite some time now, only just recently joined the mailing list and I&#8217;m extremely glad I did, especially this morning when I watched this video.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been stagnating as a player for a very long time. I pick up any bass and invariably play one of a dozen or so favorite tunes. Ones that I learned almost a decade ago and have gotten lazy and sloppy with over time, as opposed to proficient. Really setting aside the time to woodshed is very difficult in my life now [with two kids demanding most of my &#8216;free time&#8217; and an overworked wife] and I&#8217;m always kicking myself inside about not really digging in earlier. But, as you&#8217;ve said in the past and surely will say in the future, it&#8217;s never too late.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m marking this video as the push over the cliff for my encouragement. I&#8217;ve had some rough times recently and had some remarkable turn-arounds. I had to sell some of my most beloved gear to make ends meet and just yesterday received a bass from an amazing luthier here in the states [website linked in the form above for the curious] just to try out because I showed interest and asked  far too many questions haha.</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s easily distracted again? Oh, right, so anyway, recent events have encouraged me to really place a focus on my musical education and to dedicate more time and energy into that aspect of my life since I find it so fulfilling when I have a breakthrough. A week ago I had no idea how to pronounce half the modes and while still far from proficient, I now know which of them I like the feel of the most, and even though I don&#8217;t know all my scales or chord tones or any of that, I can turn on a drone of any old note and try to play that &#8220;feel&#8221;.</p>
<p>These are developments thanks to your teachings and constant encouragement- mostly for people you&#8217;ve never seen or will ever meet. That speaks volumes about you as a person, an educator and a musician.</p>
<p>Sincerest thanks to you, Scott.</p>
<p>All the best.<br />

<p>Just wanted to say thanks for the video, and the time you have put in to help other aspiring musicians.</p>
<p>I completely agree with what you were talking about regarding music schools/universities etc. I myself enrolled on a bass course at a music academy in September &#8217;12 and by christmas was starting to see real results. This was because I had a schedule and put in 4 hours a day. However by January &#8217;13 I had overloaded myself on way too many bands/projects, spreading myself too thinly. As a result, it was my practice (and playing) that suffered!</p>
<p>I now have 8 weeks of summer holiday and have been meaning to get back to some real hard practice. This (your) video has really put it back into perspective for me. I am really looking forward to exploring your site and other videos. </p>
<p>Thanks and all the best,<br />
Neal</p>

<p>My most recent breakthrough is your website and your lessons on YouTube (and here) which i find very motivating! So, as a person who lives without planning anything on his daily scheadule, it will be hard to start practicing in such a strict way, but maybe by doing so i will find somce consistancy in my life too! </p>
<p>I have a question however. I am currently in two not too active bands (only rehearsal once a week with each &#8211; no gigs yet). Which means i already have much work to do and material to study, but as a bassist, I would like to focus more on the direction of Jazz and funk in general end escape the Metal and Prog Rock direction of each one of the bands. How can i approach practicing the jazz approach so that i wont neglect the bands?  </p>
<p>Thank you very much for all the lessons here and i will look forward for the next breakthrough!<br />
Nick</p>

<p>I have been playing bass for 22 years but for the last 15 years I would say I have not improved much.</p>
<p>I grew up in a family with natural music talent but the danger of that being parent who convince you that you need no lessons or shouldnt bother with scales etc. I am obviously on a reasonable level having played in many bands through the years and I am tight in a band situation( mostly played rock) but f d that I struggle to be creative. </p>
<p>Your lessons have brought me back to that point where I realised the creativity is link to knowing s ales and arpeggios well enough to know where you can and cant go. It also helps to sort out incorre t fingering that self taught musos tend to develop.</p>
<p>Your lessons are great !! For years I have been to embarest to go for lessons because after 22 years I would have been far beyond what I can do if I knew scales etc well enough! Your help is getting me back in line with where I want to see myself! I feel I am progressing quickly although learing scales again are frustrating and boring but we do need em!!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

I discovered your site a few months back and have visited your lessons many times. This particular one gave me perspective, though the others are so eye-opening as well. Thanks for that. I&#8217;ve been playing since I was a kid (I&#8217;m 60yrs old now) and had always thought of myself as nothing more than a support instrument within a band and was content with that position until Jaco came along. I&#8217;ve been struggling with soloing over the years, not because I don&#8217;t know basic theory, but because I&#8217;ve never been shown how to approach the soloist&#8217;s mindset. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;ve taken on solos when given the opportunity, but I&#8217;m never satisfied with my performances.<br />
You have given me new ideas to work with (God bless the Internet) and I&#8217;m confident that a routine, such as your&#8217;s, will open new doors for me. Hey, my Dad was from Leeds!<br />
Thanks Scott<br />

<p>Thanks again for this wonderful lesson. It makes all the difference for me. My health is holding me back and it&#8217;s hard not to be frustrated all the time. But your lesson gives me a boost and I&#8217;ll start to make my schedule, although I&#8217;m afraid that 3 hours a day isn&#8217;t realistic for me. Do you know of any handy resources to make such schedule?</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>I&#8217;m 18, and i&#8217;ve been playing for around 7 years now. And i sometimes find it hard to motivate myself to get the systematic technique and scale practice i need to keep up with my fellow students (i study music in High School, or the Norwegian equivalent anyhow). But you, and your videos have helped me so much, and they help keeping me motivated. I can&#8217;t thank you enough for what you are doing, keep up the amazing work, Scott! Again, thank you so much!</p>

<p>This is not a regular thanks-giving message; in fact, your video comes in a moment of my life where I need a message badly, especially after the day of almost desperation that I&#8217;ve just experienced.<br />
You are directly speaking, in my eyes, the words of a higher entity that is &#8220;patting on my shoulder&#8221; with great love, understanding, and encouragement.<br />
What you did in this video seems really kind of divine to me.<br />
A special thank you, man.<br />

I&#8217;ve been using your website to learn basic bass theory whilst on holiday in Wales (congrats, by the way, I&#8217;ve learnt loads from you, I had next to no knowledge of bass before!). </p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m back home and finally have to opportunity to start practising what I&#8217;ve learn (on my very out-of-tune guitar, but it&#8217;s better than not being able to practise!), and I tried a bit yesterday and realised it wasn&#8217;t going to be as easy as I thought.</p>
<p>I was thinking today about if I would actually be any good at bass (I&#8217;ve been drumming for a couple of years, and tried guitar a few years ago but found it too difficult), and this video has inspired me to go pick up my guitar and tried some scales! </p>
<p>I CAN do it, if I practise consistently! Rome wasn&#8217;t built in a day; brick by brick! Thank you, from the bottom of my heart!</p>

<p>Great advice, so glad to be able to join and to find this video. Have a clear understand of how to build my daily routine now, I always did what you said which is to practice a lot in one day and lacked consistency to play day by day.</p>
<p>Just one question, I&#8217;m at around grade 3 level theory standard and stuck on that point, I have music theory books but have hit a wall on how to get past that point&#8230;any advice on how to improve or get past that?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot,</p>

<p>Been off the bass for quite a while now. Saw your lessons and found that without the actual bass guitar, I even can understand what you are teaching !

<p>So glad I found your site. Amazing amounts of smart information &#8211; and your dedication and passion for helping players come along is very apparent. Thank you, from all of us. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m watching your video about the power of practicing and what you&#8217;re saying aligns with this great book I&#8217;m reading now called Talent is Overrated by Jeff Colvin. Like Galdwell&#8217;s Outliers, it talks about the importance of putting in the time. Colvin&#8217;s book talks about the power of what specialist call &#8220;deliberate practice.&#8221; This is the idea that mindless playing for three hours a day is fun, but doesn&#8217;t do much for moving your playing forward. It&#8217;s the three hours where you are really working your mind on the things that push you into a space that you are uncomfortable &#8211; working hard mentally &#8211; that really move you forward. </p>
<p>Another key part is knowing what to practice. That&#8217;s why teachers and coaches are so important. If you don&#8217;t know what to do you can waste a lot of time doing things that won&#8217;t matter much. There&#8217;s a lot of great info about what to work on that is on your site&#8230;and you have clearly lived it and seen the success. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been playing casually for 25 years and I am dedicated to talking my playing to a new place &#8211; I can feel things moving forward. Glad to have you as part of the journey.</p>

Fantastic website! A massive thank you from all the guys on here, I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll all back me with that. However, I&#8217;m currently serving overseas in the RAF and cannot spare 3 hours a day, I wish I could! Bearing in mind I&#8217;m a rythem guitarist who has very recently switched to bass (because real musicians understand bass), Do you have any tips for folk like me?<br />
Stay frostie,<br />

Great site and great tips and lessons. As I watched and listened to this specific video about practice one thing that you said rang a little louder in my ears which was &#8220;how to practice for you&#8221;. What a fantastic point to make. I&#8217;ve been playing guitar now for about 20 or so years (started off on bass as a teen) but switched to guitar and just recently found myself missing bass and decided to get back into that as well (I&#8217;m 44 now). My point being that I&#8217;ve always approached practicing from a very personal perspective&#8230;.you have to. The old school ways of turning out scale after scale just doesn&#8217;t work for some people even though it does need to be learned, as you said. But the trick is to figure out a fun way to do it. Personally I like to run my scales over a nice and easy drum backing track, nothing to crazy but just enough so it doesn&#8217;t feel to much like donkey work.<br />
I also have a &#8220;day job&#8221; and every night I get home from work I put on my headphones, plug in and play. Guitar or Bass, doesn&#8217;t matter. Because it always start as therapy. That how I view playing, as therapy. Then before I know it I realize that it stopped being therapy and became practicing. What starts off as just playing along with some jam tracks has somehow turned into me trying to figure out what scale that guy is soloing in and becomes a lot of fun when you realize that you&#8217;ve been practicing without even trying to. But this is just how it works for me, thought I&#8217;d share.<br />
Thanks for reading. Keep up the good work.</p>

This is Stefan from Bonn/ Germany. Hope, my English is good enough. I enjoy your lessons and i Need to Say, before i found your side, i was near to give up Bass learning. I&#8217;m an absolute Beginner and it was my dream, to become a musican. Now i&#8217;m 51 and i will start. My Daughters like it and maybe they want to start playing an Instrument too&#8230;.that one more reason to learn hard:-)<br />
Today i had made a plan for me, how i can learn for three hours a day. Not easy but possible.<br />
There is a way, if i will. 1-1-1 Morning Afternoon Evening<br />
Thank you very much for teaching me/us.<br />
One special question do i have: do you like to tell me the factory who made your wool Pullover? I like it.<br />
Have a Nice day,</p>
<p>Thank you,<br />
Stefan</p>

<p>Thank you for all that you do. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m on the verge of my 63rd birthday.  I&#8217;ve started and stopped playing bass more times than I would like to admit.  Having just discovered your website, I&#8217;m very impressed, not just with your obvious musical talent, but perhaps more importantly, with your ability to communicate about those psychological and emotional triggers that you became aware of in yourself and that impact most of us human beings.  </p>
<p>It could be said that there are a lot of great bass players and musicians in general &#8211; but in my experience, there only a small percentage that have the &#8220;whole package,&#8221; &#8211; the ability to impart musical knowledge in an empathetic, encouraging context.</p>
<p>Some things you talk about, for example, lack of focus, interest in multiple subjects/topics at once, etc. &#8211; for me, also include severe lack of attention issues at times.  </p>
<p>Back in college, there was a book that I believe was called something like, &#8220;If You Don&#8217;t Know Where You&#8217;re Going, You&#8217;ll Probably End Up Somewhere Else.&#8221;  I have often felt that way.  </p>
<p>However, structure, discipline and many other musical and personal ideas that you communicate about in your videos and on your website do help!</p>
<p>O.K., I need to stop now because I don&#8217;t want tears in my keyboard or on my bass&#8230;</p>
<p>Thank you for inspiring me again.</p>
<p>Best, Neil</p>

I work in my church as well as a disco/funk review band and rehearse 2-3 hours a week as well as 2-3 gigs a week. I have been searching for a plan to rise to the next level of playing. Instead of learning songs I want to learn to think and play better and to learn fundamental techniques and build strength so that my overall performance improves.  I am so glad I found your website. This introduction sets things up very well by establishing a practical, scheduled, plan. Thank you Scott.</p>

I am a guitar player from Puerto Rico but I have found that your teachings on Bass guitar are great. I recently aquired a bass guitar ( thanks to you), and I feel really motivated to learn more. You are the coolest teacher and I want to say thank you.</p>

I haven&#8217;t formally taken a music degree besides band 12 but when playing with my old pro gig I used to transcribe for the whole band . This included a 16 year grade 8 royal conservatory trained pianist, Berkeley grad bass player , guitarist and drummer who all had touring experience as well. I wish I could tell you a secret but there isn&#8217;t any but consistently listening to pieces and breaking them down . If you know a little music theory then by the sound of things you can begin to instantly know what it is eg that sounds sad probably a minor key  , or last chord was the root this next run is in the 4( in a 1-4-5 typical progression ) . It can be tedious but the reward is freedom<br />
From tablature and being able to play what you hear WHEN you hear it . A musician who learns by ear sticks out from tab learners . They are the players with much more attention to detail warmth and personality in their playing . It&#8217;s well worth it especially when playing live with other musicians . You&#8217;ll gain a confidence that will open the doors to a magical world . Good luck !</p>

Recently signed up to your site and I&#8217;m learning so much about playing bass. I&#8217;m from the more &#8220;mature&#8221; generation and only recently taken up the bass. I work with adults with learning difficulties and work with a small group laying down a tune to eventually produce a cd as proof of their efforts&#8230;and mine.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found your site very helpful with all your tips, especially about the approach to practicing. Unfortunately the bass has to stay at the place I work BUT some of your words have helped me improve how I approach the bass and I&#8217;m putting some of this into practice. Great site.</p>

I gave up after being in these bands because I did not have the confidence in myself. Even though I could cowboy my way through a gig. I went overseas for big chunks of that time and did not even think about playing the bass again, but there was something pulling back me to playing again. I have been taking lessons again and am finding it much more fun as I learn more things. I guess I understand the bass and music more. So glad I found your site and look forward to more lessons from you.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-14197" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I always enjoy Scott&#8217;s videos. I think when it comes to things like practice and getting better *technically* &#8212; learning things likes modes and scales and whatnot (things that make my eyes glaze over because I have pretty much the same attention deficit thing Scott mentions, too) &#8212; I think it&#8217;s also important to also think of *what* you&#8217;re practicing and want to get better in, in terms of your individual style. For example, if you&#8217;re someone with more of a Jamerson bent, practicing to become as technically proficient with the same feel/style as someone like Jaco (and to some degree, the way Scott plays) will just be frustrating. Like Scott says, you have to take the things that will benefit YOU and your own style and your own sound, and know what you need to make you a better bass player that YOU are.</p>
<p>The world is full of people who are amazingly proficient on guitar, but there&#8217;s no *feel*, no soul, in what they&#8217;re playing. Having soul and feel is probably the ONE thing that&#8217;ll carry you thru even if you&#8217;re not technically proficient and practiced, but you still gotta understand and *see* how music works. And that&#8217;s where sitting down every week with your instrument comes in.</p>

Years of playing and determination got me through gigs until I got surgery on my left arm back in January.  It;s slowly coming back, and later this year I;ll get the surgery on my right hand. but I&#8217;m still gigging and practicing your great lessons.

I&#8217;m a 67 old lady and played bass for much of my working life. I was never great but I could keep a beat. Over time, I&#8217;ve lost my basses and recently made myself a bass ukulele just to have something to practice on. Now I&#8217;ve got three instruments to practice.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using on online habit developer program to keep track of my practicing. It really works for me since it rewards the user for completing tasks and takes away points for missed ones.  Now I&#8217;m focusing on what to practice. Thank you, thank you.</p>

I&#8217;ve just signed up for SBL Academy yesterday and am very glad I found you to be my first source of help in learning to play the bass for the first time. I really connected and can relate to something you said toward the beginning when you talked about how easily distracted you were, that seems to be my whole life, both personal and professional. I have a very demanding job that is considerably beyond the standard 40 hours and as such, a 3 hour a day commitment may not be possible right now but I do plan on carving out a 1 hour window each day for now and staying totally committed and focused as you encourage! Even that will be ground breaking for me and a great start. Once again, thanks and I&#8217;m looking forward to the many hours I&#8217;ll be in the SBL Academy and maybe even meet some people where we can be a mutual source of encouragement and accounting.</p>

I am from Argentina, I played the bass when I was young, after 20 years I want to return to it, and I am in it since 2 months ago. I found your videos great to recover what I hope is still there in my head.<br />
As I don´t speak English very well, I have a question. You mention  ´Transcriptions´, or that is what I understand, but I don´t know what does it exactly means in this context&#8230; could you help me a little bit with the meaning please?. I think that you are saying that you listen to a music and write it down in a pentagram, am I correct?</p>

I wish I had 3 hours in a day to dedicate to practice but I understand what you mean about routine.  I&#8217;ve been playing the same few things over and over for 4 years now, down loading a song tab and learning it but basically getting nowhere with my playing.  But thanks to you and your website I&#8217;ve decided to &#8216;go back to basics&#8217; and learn where the notes are (yes seriously I&#8217;ve been playing almost 4 years now and until about a week ago couldn&#8217;t tell you where any of the notes on the fret board were), and focus on learning the scales.  3 hours a day is impossible for me but between 30 minutes and an hour I think I can manage.</p>

I wish to expand a little your concepts you told in the video: it is absolutely right to practicise every day for the aumont of hours you can have (2-3 even 8 if you have that time) but it&#8217;s important also HOW to practicise. Music luckily is not a bare exercise on your istrument, and you should understand the reason why you play as you play. I mean: do you like to play in 16th, with a Jaco sound? Why? What if i play with the style of another bassist, for exemple a melodic one such as Paul McCartney? Try to understand the melody on the ex Beatle bass lines, for exemple. Or, you could practicise your favourite phrases in a different part of the keyboard: on the bridge pickup, on the neck one and on the keyboard, listen the sound of your bass in theese 3 positions and try to undrestand WHEN you should play them. Making so, the practicise become more interesting, because you go INTO the music, into your personal music.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for this video as well as all your other ones. This one in particular really encourages me to continue with my practicing as well as staying motivated. My roommate and I are the only two bass guitar performance majors at Lindenwood University in St. Charles, MO. He&#8217;s been playing for eight years while I have been playing for one. Sometimes it is tough getting lost in his shadow and there are multiple times that I have thought about giving up because I thought I could never get to his level or be great like so many other bassist that I have heard. Your words really help me to keep going, knowing that everything is within my reach as long as I practice ad am serious about what I am doing.</p>
<p>Thank You!<br />

The routine you described in this video was just what I needed to hear, and I feel hopeful about constructing my own based on 3 sessions of fretboard theory, transcription and repertoire.

<p>I am coming back to playing seriously after about a year of just occasional goofing around with the bass, but no real practicing. i can attest to the importance of WHAT you practice being possibly more important than how much time you spend doing it. It really does take a systematic approach to be a well rounded player. For a few years I also devoted about 15 hours a week to practicing, but realize that I was only really emphasizing learning songs, which led me to be very confident in certain keys, but almost terrified in others. I also found myself very limited in my phrasing vocabulary. Any time playing is good, but it is so easy to get into a rut where your fingers and brain always run to their happy places and limit your playing when you just play songs you like or noodle.</p>
<p>A couple of things that I have found helpful that yourself and those here might also find helpful are:</p>
<p>&#8211; Being mindful while practicing rather than mindlessly playing through comfy patterns will make the time way more effective.</p>
<p>&#8211; I can have dedicated days for each emphasis (technique/chord tone/scales &#8211; transcription &#8211; jamming) instead of trying to do it all every day. Many times people cannot manage 3 big separate chunks of time. If I only have an hour a day I would focus on one aspect rather than dividing it up into 3 smaller sections. </p>
<p>&#8211; Once I learn a technical aspect (chord tones, approach notes, scales, ect.) I quit playing them as exercises and immediately put them in a musical context by using a play a long track that can work in all keys. </p>
<p>&#8211; The pressure of playing in front of people regularly, even if it is just a jam session, is a great way to make sure I practice.</p>

Bass: the most underrated function in music. &#8211; but mostly underrated by bassplayers themselves, by not appreciating the responsibility that they carry..</p>
<p>I was once told: &#8220;A band is not a democracy!&#8221; in that context meaning that if the bass screws up the whole band screws up, so it is<br />
the bassplayer who &#8216;holds the band by the goolies&#8217; for want of a better explanation.. especially in jazz.</p>
<p>Excellent motivational video indeed. However one aspect needs greater emphasis:<br />
LEARN TO SIGHT READ DOTS!<br />
Much more important than flashy chops! (How many of those show-off YouTubers can really groove..??)<br />
Reading especially needs some consistent focus every day! Jaco himself said over and over again: &#8220;Learn to read.. If you can only read a bit, then you can&#8217;t read..!&#8221; (LOL)<br />
Learn to read, and not only bass clef, but treble clef comes in handy too, because there are times when you might be handed a chart with only lead sheet dots and no chords.. it does happen.. and then you&#8217;re stuck in a very hard place and have to basically pull roots (for a start) out of these bars of &#8216;fly sh*t&#8217;.. a daunting task at the best of times! eg. had a big band gig recently when this happened.. very stressful..!<br />
On the other hand, learning the melody will always enhance one&#8217;s approach to the piece.</p>
<p>If I had to name one single thing that has hampered my music career in any way, it is my struggle with sight reading.<br />
The classically trained players sight read first time right and provide very stiff competition, esp for upper level gigs &#8211; if they can groove, of course..! :D</p>
<p>Peace<br />

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-15969" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Scott ~ Thank you! I agree with you completely, especially with the consistency part. When I first started playing almost 20 years ago, I was single and didn&#8217;t have a lot of responsibilities, so I was able to practice up to 12 hours a day! It was awesome!!  Fast forward to present and I&#8217;m married with 3 kids, and working 2 jobs from 8:30AM &#8211; 10:30PM, Monday &#8211; Friday. Thus, I have had to MAKE the time to practice, not just take the time, so the idea of scheduling is certainly sound advice. Obviously, I can&#8217;t practice as much as I would like on a daily basis, but I know that it&#8217;s the consistency that will pay off in the end. Thank you for your teaching, leadership, and talent. I&#8217;m honored to be part of the SBL University and I&#8217;m already reaping the benefits of becoming a member!  I appreciate everything that you and the SBL Team are doing to help us &#8220;Low-End&#8221; fanatics realize and our potential!! God&#8217;s Best!!!</p>

This video is exactly what I&#8217;ve been looking for and one is one of the main things that was holding me back a lot which is the idea of greatness and prodigies which is exactly what you talked about in the video. I go to a music school with people who have all been playing since really early ages like 4 or something mad like that and consequently they are all really good musicians some are absolutely amazing for their age. And as amazing as that is for them it really made me think that the only way to be good is to be either, what i thought, born with the gift or play from an early age like they have and that really put me down and made me think that I&#8217;m so much behind them is there any point in carrying on, will i ever catch up to them? But thanks to this video you have opened my eyes and made me realize that it&#8217;s all in my grasp and that if I believe and work my ass off ill become as good as i want to be. So thank you very much Scott you lifted a massive rock off my shoulders and ill gonna work hard and achieve :D</p>

I have chronic pain in my cervical spine from a roll over car accident I had when 28 years old , soon I will be 59 and playing bass keeps the pain off my mind . It took 10 years to learn to live with chronic pain. I got dependent upon painkillers for awhile and that made matters worse , thinking I need this filled , appointments with the doctor then going to the pharmacies it was a disaster. It actually made my pain worse after a few years.<br />
So it took 3 months to taper off and finally I got clear of that and learned ways to deal with my chronic pain .<br />
I have to keep my hands and mind busy all the time. I started playing bass when I was 18 years old ,then laid it down for 15 years now I cant sit it down , 4 hours a day I practice. I need to learn scales better, I cant sit in from of the computer very long , this is the amount I can type at any given time.<br />
Thanks&#8217; for your help , just think you even help people disabled with chronic pain find peace of mind.</p>

That was until I actually tried it, thinking that some Beatles or Stones might be an easy avenue to the four-stringed beast.  Bzzzt!  Guess again!

I am a young 59 y.o. self taught bass player.  I started out by learning a gospel recording (on 45 rpm disc, remember those??), note for note.  Since I didn&#8217;t and unfortunately still cannot read (please don&#8217;t frown), it took me about a week, after school of course.  But, amazingly, I did it.  I&#8217;ve always just played for my own satisfaction, not much else.  But, watching just a couple of your videos, has inspired me to branch out and reach for higher heights.  Oh, by the way, I just love the way you play!!  Take care and keep up the GOOD work!!</p>

I&#8217;m in the same situation as you when you were 18.<br />
I&#8217;m 17 and nobody in my family can play something,I&#8217;m in a small band and I feel like if I don&#8217;t get better,soon i&#8217;ll be heavy for the band to do well.<br />
I also put in it a lot of passion and as u said I know what are my &#8220;breaking points&#8221; and that I can be distracted so easily.<br />
This lessons are so important for me cause it&#8217;s like learning what an &#8220;adult me&#8221; learned and for this I really wanna thank you.<br />

Too many of us beat ourselves up over every little mistake we make, when an actuality these are merely ever climbing steps on our progression. The pinnacle of success is built upon a mountain of &#8220;failure&#8221; or better said practice. Thank You Scott! Comparing this to University places the process into its proper light, brick by brick we build up our skills.</p>

Thank you very much for this video, are lessons and tips that had probably heard before, but that not being committed to this instrument, set aside. Now it is different and the good thing is that there is now a master who can guide me. Thanks Scott!</p>

I started playing the bass when I was 17 but I&#8217;d want to move to the next level as you&#8217;re saying. You&#8217;re so honest, God bless you. May I ask, what is the best bass guitar forum online in your experience?</p>

I began the Bass 3 years ago because I liked how it made me feel and I thought it might be one of the easier instruments to learn this late in life. I took lessons from a guitarist teacher only because there was no Bass Teacher within my area. I learned very little in those first two years. I moved a year ago to an area that has a qualified Bass Teacher and have taken weekly lessons for the last 9 months. The one thing I still struggle with is a well defined outline of what to practice in starting out. I&#8217;ll put the time in&#8230;.if I have an outline (game plan) of what are the first month&#8217;s &#8216;building blocks&#8217;. I feel sometimes that I am one of those students that just bounce around the universe each time Insit down to practice. Many thanks for your incredible website! You are definitely a great teacher and inspirater.</p>

I have been curious and interested about bass for a long time (more than 20 years) but had never really started studying the thing until I discovered your site a few months ago.  Now, after playing guitar for 20+ years and drums for 10 years more than that, I have bought my very first bass and amp, and am following your lessons to learn how to play, really learn.  I&#8217;ve been self-taught throughout, and being able to review basic elements of technique, posture, chords, arpeggios, is proving to be an eye opener.  So, thank you massively.</p>

This lesson was great, I&#8217;m going to start a practice log for my flute immediately. And for the bass when I get it&#8230;hope it gets here sooner.<br />
By the way, I&#8217;m in the &#8220;States&#8221;, Santa Fe, New Mexico @ 7,000 feet altitude! Practicing the flute can be dizzying but the bass will ground me good. Peace.</p>
