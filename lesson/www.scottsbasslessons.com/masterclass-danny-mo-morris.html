Will the SBL Academy be right for me?</p><p class="faq_answer">Yes! We have a specific course for beginners that will take you through 'exactly' what you need to know to get going on your new bass. But more than that, here at SBL Academy we have "The Campus" - the largest bass educational forum in the world. Our members are a true inspiration in the way they help and guide people just like you. You will have somewhere to ask questions, get feedback and direction 24hrs a day.</p><p class="faq_question">I am an intermediate to advanced bass player.

So if you want to really challenge yourself and take your bass playing to the next level you're in the right place. Get ready, Scott is going to get you working harder than you've ever done before.</p><p class="faq_question">I'm a professional bass player and teaching my own students. Is the Academy right for me?</p><p class="faq_answer">Yes! In fact our members already include bass players that have taught or are teaching right now in Universities and music schools around the world. Many of our members are actually using Scott's teaching philosophies with their own students so we invite you to do the same!</p><p class="faq_question">Can I ask Scott questions directly?</p><p class="faq_answer">Yes. Every other week we have a completely live Q&A masterclass with Scott. You can pre-submit your questions or even ask him your questions live. Plus, if you miss the live Q&A each one "Bass-Hang" (that's what we call them!) is recorded and then uploaded into the Bass-hang archive so you can watch in your own time.</p><p class="faq_question">Why should I become a member today instead of waiting?</p><p class="faq_answer">It's time for you to take action.
