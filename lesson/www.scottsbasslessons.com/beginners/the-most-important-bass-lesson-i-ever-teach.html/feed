		<description><![CDATA[Eh, I&#039;ve started playing bass around my 16&#039;s, had years of classes and music theory, at some point I just had tons of &quot;tools&quot;i to my hands thst I had no idea how to apply them. I quit playing due lack of time anyway, but decided to come back to play after 15 years without holding a bass and decided to join SBL, the beginner&#039;s session just made tons of stuff clear, how and where to apply scales, arpeggios, chords, etc to create bas lines, is just amazing. Thanks Scott...
Hopefully I&#039;ll come back to gigging some time in the future.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ha, you got a keyboard on your keyboard. Good points on doing even a little every day. Started late at 48. No worries, plenty of time. I am stoked your classes are so good. It&#039;s not about becoming a pro but just becoming as good as YOU can get. Aim high - I want to play for a full auditorium.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Me too.  Borrowed a friend&#039;s bass about 4 months before my 50th birthday and bought a bass the same month as my 50th birthday.  That was about 3 years ago.  It seems like most of my gains have been made in the last year, but I know (after having played drums for 35 years) that the upfront practice/fumbling was key to where I am now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, you gave a great pep talk. You are so right with setting a goal which should be everyone&#039;s objective. I would like to play like you, Victor Wooten, Getty Lee and so on but at my age, 62, I know I may not have the dexterity to achieve that height of playing, but I will continue trying to be better than I am today which should be the outlook of all.  
Some people may set a height level that may not be obtainable which in turn can discourage them.  They need to understand that each one will progress with the gifts they were born with, hard work and understanding that the main goal is to be better than the day before. Since watching your videos and really listening to your instruction, I have a better understanding of technique, chords and learning how to read music from your work sheets making me better than I was.
In closing, I would like to thank you for being there to help me and all like me.

		<description><![CDATA[Great info as always, Scott. I started &quot;late&quot; also. Piano. During college years. Gradually moved to guitar. Learning how music works via the piano keyboard made (and makes) the transition to the fretboard much easier. Here I am 20+ years later picking up the bass. Love it! I&#039;m grateful to have found your site. Thanks to you, I&#039;ve almost got the first part of the head to &#039;Donna Lee&#039;. It&#039;s still at a very, very slow tempo, and will be for a while. Building technique in baby steps. Much appreciated, man. Keep up the great work. You&#039;re an inspiration. Be well!]]></description>
