In the two weeks I&#039;ve had my bass, I&#039;ve progressed fairly well and I know repetition and practice are key. Are there any resources to help me learn the notes on the fingerboard? Tab just tells me what fret to play. I notice in your walking bass lesson, you mention thirds and fifths. Are those the third and fifth notes in the scale that begins with a particular note?

		<description><![CDATA[This was a great lesson Scott!
I&#039;m very happy I found your website!
Ear training is VERY essential to playing music and I&#039;m glad there&#039;s a way to practice it.

Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hey shed maker :) I came across this site which has a list of well known songs and their intervals with links to youtube clips. Seeing as you were describing this as a way to help recall intervals I figured it may be of help to others

Of course we must to study scale, modes ecc..then try to play everything because increase our background.  Anyway I doing every day arpeggios, scales but what really help me is sing the notes.  I hate my voice but it work with me.

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, 
This is a fantastic lesson, i am a beginner to the bass, i have been playing drums for ages and my back is cactus, so still loving music i have taken up the bass just weeks ago and find your lessons very inspiring. It is the same thing i have been doing when i listen to music, i try to hear the time and the beat and this lesson was about the same type of thing, i have never thought about the music in regards to the bass but now i am doing it to the bass guitar riff.
Thanks for a great lesson and i will continue to watch your videos.

		<description><![CDATA[I always wondered why some musicians seem to &#039;talk&#039; to you with ease and fluency when I hear them play while others don&#039;t. The way you explained the importance of hearing and recognising of intervals in music has made the penny drop for me, it&#039;s exactly like learning a spoken language (native or foreign), . If I only have a primary school education I can only communicate at that level with others, if I continue learning to higher grades of education I have so much more ability to express myself. Music will always be a mystery to me but since I have recently found your lessons it&#039;s becoming less frustrating, thank you for your generosity in sharing what you&#039;ve learned.]]></description>
