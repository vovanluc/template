		<description><![CDATA[Just getting started Scott with bass and this academy. I&#039;ve played rhythm guitar for quite some time but my home church needs a bass player. So I bought a bass set up and I&#039;m giving it me best shot. One of my bass players from the past turned me onto your academy. I&#039;m loving it. I&#039;ve taught myself enough to be able to perform with the worship team but am really an amateur. Looking forward to learning and growing. I&#039;ll see if I can figure out this practice log thing. God bless brother!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Shared on my FB page and Twitter. The Twitter a/c is more music orientated than my FB.
Many thanks for all of the advice, Scott, and once my 14 day trial is up I will become a full member.
Keep the rhythm grooving everyone. :-) x]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s easier said than done. I have a very similar problem. I started playing the bass and due to many reasons finding a teacher was very difficult so I fell into the &quot;self study&quot; loop. My biggest problem was that I didn&#039;t have a theory background and some concepts were very difficult to visualise and see the application when I did try and get stuck into theory because I wouldn&#039;t understand what they were trying to say to me. I&#039;ve played in bands and my skill level and technique has improved, although why what I play works sometimes still eludes me. The problem was I didn&#039;t start with the basics and this is a personal evaluation, others will no doubt probably have a different experience. I&#039;m slowly starting from scratch in order to build a better understanding of why, what I play, sounds good. I also found looking at music from not just a bassists perspective but also from a guitar and drum point of view has helped me. When it came to rhythm, drumming patterns and counting like a drummer has done wonders for playing in different time signatures and understanding how to make the most of how much &quot;space&quot; I allow in groove creation. Learning to play guitar has also done wonders for understanding why chords works together in respect to what key I&#039;m playing in. I get stuck on the small inaccuracies of my own playing which quickly frustrates me and I will try to do everything else besides that one thing that frustrates me :). This has been a limiter in my own development for a long time. What&#039;s working for me is dropping the ego and starting from the basics, even if its boring, delaying gratification instead of looking for instant gratification. I know I can play and its easy to play the things you know. It&#039;s difficult to play those that are not inspiring and boring, but music just like language needs to be built from the ground up in order to understand why what you doing is working. I don&#039;t want to be a bass payer I would like to be a musician. It&#039;s easy to be a bassist and play the things that work, like the root and the chord tones that are associated to the chords a guitarist is playing in a band scenario, but being a musician and writing music yourself is a whole new ball game. Like Sylvain said, if it&#039;s what you want you need to be selfish and put more time into your own development. I think the turning point for me was stopping and asking am I happy to be just a bassist playing what others are playing or do I want to be a musician and take the plunge into learning the language and making use of it myself in order to express myself more. For me the emphasis has shifted from being good in a band to being good on the bass.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[..Scott , I find its hard to practice improving my general &quot;music&quot; knowledge because I spend all my time working on cover tunes that I play with my band...always practicing the bands songs and never really progressing as a bass player....sometimes u almost want to take a break from bands to get back to the instrument....but the point would be to be better within bands ...so its like a catch 22!....do you know how to deal with this phenomenon?]]></description>
