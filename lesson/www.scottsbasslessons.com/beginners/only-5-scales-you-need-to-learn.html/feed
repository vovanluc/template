		<description><![CDATA[So as your floating around the neck in the C Maj scale, when you shift your hand position are you staying in the key of C? What about the other keys like an AMaj scale? When I play blues I play a lot of major scale shuffles, say A, E, and F. I use the major scale pattern in each key (or do you call them chords)? I&#039;m just starting these lessons and I actually play a lot but I&#039;ve never really known exactly what I&#039;m doing, I hear it pretty well. I&#039;m struggling with how you flew over 
the fretboard saying it&#039;s all in the CMaj scale. Show me the light please! ;D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Anita I am no longer on the 14 day trial. That expired a long time ago but the problems I had was one I was trying to navigate to Danny Moe lessons which I really enjoyed Scott&#039;s interview with him but it kept taking me to some other guys lessons which I really didn&#039;t appreciate his style]]></description>
