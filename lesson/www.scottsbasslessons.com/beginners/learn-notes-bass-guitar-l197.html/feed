		<description><![CDATA[This approach seems very natural to me. I&#039;ve only been learning bass for 2 years but it seems like a very visual thing. I&#039;m actually a bit amazed that anyone would be thinking about the notes rather than the patterns.

I wonder if this is different with sight reading? (which I can&#039;t do). I guess that&#039;s a very different process of music making though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, like 494 Hz.  It&#039;s written &quot;B&quot; but pronounced Hah.  (The H is for &quot;Hypo&quot;.)  Not to be confused with Bb, which is written &quot;Bb&quot; but pronounced Beh - which is quite confusing at first.
Classical musicians live and breathe this stuff, the ones who travel throughout Europe have to learn all these different naming conventions.  Maybe there&#039;s a classically trained bass player out there who can chime in...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After i saw the show yesterday i came up with about the same exercises, so i guess this lesson works perfectly for me :)
I think this is the most important basics every bassist/guitarist should get into really early.
The progress can be very fast, if you always change patterns while calling the note names, so the brain does not adapt to the same pattern.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When it comes to saying notes aloud as you play, I really like the german note names a lot better than english.  (I worked in Germany for a few years and a co-worker taught me the system, I hope he knew what he was talking about because at this point it&#039;s deeply engrained...)  In a nutshell, to make a note flat you add an &#039;es&#039; suffix, and to make it sharp you add &#039;is&#039;.  Yeah, there&#039;s a weird thing about H and B but once you get past that, saying the notes as you play is much less fatiguing.

Example: G# harmonic minor out loud in English is &quot;G-sharp A-sharp B C-sharp D-sharp E F-double-sharp G-sharp&quot; - quite a mouthful.
In Germa that would be &quot;Gis Ais Hah Cis Dis Eh Fisis Gis&quot;. 
I guess the down side of german is that it&#039;s pretty useless for communicating with other musicians.  (Well, unless you happed to be there...)]]></description>
