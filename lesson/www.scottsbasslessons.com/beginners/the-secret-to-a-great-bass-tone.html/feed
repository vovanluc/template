		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve played regular 6-string guitars my whole life and decided to start playing the bass guitar. I am so used to playing a guitar with a pick or with my thumb that I feel more comfortable playing the bass with my thumb. Is playing the bass with your thumb a bad practice or technique? If it is, then how can I break this lifelong habit?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Scott! 32 year old here getting back into the bass after many years away. I really wish you were around when I was a teenager! There are so many good lessons here that I never knew about. It&#039;s never to late though to make music!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I started learning the bass maybe 4 months ago.  This was the first site I came across, I immediately contributed and have been so glad I did.   The only real way to learn is the doing of course, but having actual practical lessons (other than what I pay for once a week) helps immensely]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One certainly lets early playing habits mess up progress. After 42 years of playing bass in a particular right hand position, last night during rehearsal session, I applies this lesson to change dynamics within the songs. Got the big thumbs-up from the lead singer and the drummer..,(I didn&#039;t know drummers heard anything!). Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bang on! I was in a music shop back in the 70&#039;s, Tempo in West Ealing, a bass player called Dave Green was in there shooting the breeze when a woman came in with the worst piece of crap bass - a Kay copy of a Gibson EB3. She wanted new strings on it for her son. Dave kindly offered to string it for her, and then plugged it in to tune it up, check it over. It sounded AMAZING.. It&#039;s all in the hands. ;) Someone mentioned Rickenbacker - so many people assume they&#039;re hearing Rickenbacker with Geddy Lee of Rush. Most of the time though it&#039;s Jazz Bass played with aggression.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott,

Thanks as always, great insight into something bass players normally take for granted. I have been playing for 30 years and still really enjoy going through your lessons. Thanks man!!
