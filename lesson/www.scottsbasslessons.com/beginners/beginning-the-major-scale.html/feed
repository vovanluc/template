		<description><![CDATA[Well Scott,all i can say is thanks..Whether it was stumbling onto you by accident on y/t or just an inner urge to say &quot;f&#038;*^k  it ...it&#039;s time to get serious&#039;&#039; as to where my motivation came from i&#039;m not sure...Regardless of that..after beginning bass 12 months or so ago after 28 + years as a drummer and playing everything on the low E string :) I thought bugger it i need to progress...
I&#039;ve seen plenty of other video&#039;s on y/t on scales etc but the presenter just never seemed to grab me.I dig your stuff and the way you present.Awesome bro.

I started on the C Maj scale last night and almost bailed after 10 mins (typical drummer lack of patience) and then suddenly got used to spreading my fingers and started getting it ! Awesome !

I followed your advice re.scheduling and committed to 1 hour tonight and,well,almost 2 hours later i was still rockin but have to pull up as working a day job too ...Also spreading the webbing in my hand was getting a tad sore.
I got a groove going and played the scale that way to keep the interest up...Going great ! Have registered here and subbed on y/t..Thanks mate,Love it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Please help me clarify something. . . So &quot;THE Major Scale&quot; is just all major notes. But what defines it as a &quot;C&quot; major is starting/ending with C. Would that be the same with a &quot;D&quot; major scale? Starts and ends with &quot;D&quot;? The same for A or G or F or E, then? Its just starting in a different place on the alphabet of notes and circling back around to the octave below (or above) of your first note? Is it really that simple? That&#039;s genius if it is. Even I can do this stuff, eventually, ha!

Great lessons, Scott. Thank you for all of your effort to teach this beautiful craft.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott.
Love your bass lessons! Do you have any lessons on the correct technique/finger positions for going up the fret board during 2 octave scales? I want to find a way for them to sound more smoothly when going up the neck and I noticed that you played a 2 octave scale in this video. Thank you!]]></description>
