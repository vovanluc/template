		<description><![CDATA[Thank you! The #1 lesson IS truly number one! Number 4 would be the one many modern bass players forget. You are not a guitarist with four strings, you are the rhythmic and harmonic foundation of the band! Pino Palladino is a great example.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Take care of your gear.  I have a friend that tried to do something stupid with his guitar one time and ended up with a broken tuning knob and a nick in the neck.  This also applies to things like proper storage, making sure to change strings instead of using a dead set, and maintaining your hardware so that you&#039;re always ready to play.  Some people forget that any kind of instrument is an investment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[yeah I say having lessons or mentorship like sbl and playing with others-especially in a band setting and when one or more are better than the bassist- are the most beneficial methods. 

then like that writer and Scott talk about, sometimes I wonder if I&#039;ve paid my 10,000 hours worth of dues. I think surely I have but haven&#039;t yet estimated the math. 

great advice as always. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yet another video packed with great advice, thanks Scott. The only thing I would add is that if you do not already have a dedicated practice space at home you should set one up. Having a permanent space with your gear ready to be used can boost your mindset. This makes it easier getting into a daily routine knowing that you don’t need to set and then pack away your gear every time you want to play.]]></description>

So i&#039;m going to ask it:  how do I know I&#039;m practicing the right things?]]></description>
