		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, 

I think there are a lot of bass players who would like to own there
&quot;perfect&quot; bass guitar. The problem is often that a bass guitar
that lives up to ones wishes is most of the time expensive. Therefore I think reviews on bass guitars up to let’s say 1000 pound/euro/dollar might beinteresting.

What also might be nice is some lessons/info about pick-ups (difference between brands), wood (resonant spec’s, tone colour) strings, fredboards (resonant spec’s, tone colour), (D)tuners etc. for those who want to build their own bass guitar or want to make some changes/improvements on the bass they already have. Of Corse also because that is where I’m now ;-)

Btw, thanks for all your lessons so far. Realy great !!

		<description><![CDATA[I think it would be awesome if you did a video every so often that really broke down a specific genre and the style of playing involved. For example, you could break it down into a few parts such as- general style/feel of the bass parts associated with the genre, mention a few artists/bassists to check out to hear more of that style, maybe a brief mention of soloing over it (if it&#039;s a genre like jazz where improv solos are passed around, or a genre where bass is more likely to be given a solo), some typical EQ/Pickup settings to get a decent tone for the genre, etc. There&#039;s all kinds of stuff you could do with it but would be cool to see something like that. Another thing that would be neat would to see would be a breakdown of songs/solos that would be meant to challenge us. Maybe a groove with some tricky rhythms, or a solo with some tricky/weird phrases etc. I&#039;m also fond of the idea of interviews and gear reviews :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott - for me, I&#039;d like to see some tips on recording - both in the studio and at home. What gear to use, techniques - and importantly... TONE. What sounds good solo doesn&#039;t always work in a group setting. Also - what equipment are you using for your videos; cams and processors; any special lighting etc? 

Interviews are always interesting - with the right people and the right questions... rig rundowns are cool. Gear reviews - maybe; you just have to keep the site honest and don&#039;t show any favouritism... 

Last thing - you need to go to Wooten Woods and meet with Victor Wooten and do an interview. He is just the most awesome teacher (and his brothers too) I ever met. Learnt more in 1 week than I did in the 20 years previously... Do it! 

Keep rockin. Steve.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,

Also enjoying your lessons big time!

I would really like to hear how to get the best tone when recording bass and tips for mixing bass as well.

When recording bass I mean something about the recording chains and settings for different styles... but also how to play. 
It seems that your right hand is not really playing all that hard (as opposed to what lot of teachers tell their students to smack the ¤#&quot;! out of the bass... maybe just to make them train their finger muscles...) and you play really balanced even though the accents are very obvious which I would really strive for in a recording as well as live.

Thank you!
Dennis]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First, allow me to just thank you for the incredible amount of work you do to help other bass players.  Currently I&#039;m between bands, so am taking advantage of this time to improve my technique.
I don&#039;t see how you can shorten the bass lessons more than they are.  I tend to hang on to (and learn from) every word you say.
Reviews about gear and tips on how to use it, etc., would be great.  Technique tips (beyond lessons), such as short cuts, improvising/playing by ear and tips on how to provide the drive behind the band. e.g.working with the drums and percussion to creat the feel of a tune.  Eric]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, you have really helped me develop as a bass player and I&#039;m forever grateful for your all your help. About suggestions, maybe you could do tutorials on playing different genres (jazz, african, carribean, latin american etc) .Also if you could do a tutorial on chords because you seem to use them a lot in your lessons. Thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interviews
Gear reviews!

I was also thinking of song lessons. Not just playing along, but bigger, deeper, not that easy.
Take a song your average viewer is not able to play correctly and teach us how to create that certain feeling/sound/rythm/speed/...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tell us something about the business side of music. Booking a gig, how to acquire a manager, n&#039; stuff like that. That would be very very useful.

You&#039;re lessons are great and matter a great deal to a lot of people.

Cheers.]]></description>
