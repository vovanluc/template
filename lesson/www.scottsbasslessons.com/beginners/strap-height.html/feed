		<description><![CDATA[There is some room for adjustment. The bass can be a bit lower, or higher. This is a topic a talk about when I encounter new students to the bass, or guitar for that matter. I tell them to experiment with strap height and find a spot that is most comfortable for both your fret hand wrist, and your plucking / pick hand. I demonstrate why it&#039;s bad to have the bass too low by showing them the strain that is put on the wrist.

I wear my bass somewhat lower than in the tutorial. But I hold the neck angle more like an upright, a-la Mike Porcaro. It is a comfortable position up and down the neck, and also leaves my other hand in a very neutral psition too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m torn on this subject. I have small hands and started on guitar and then upright. I&#039;m aware of four finger positioning but it does feel like an unnatural strain on frets 1-4. Especially when I try any sort of speed, like in F#maj from the E string for i.e.  and I find myself switching sometimes between the two techniques. In the four finger pos., when my fourth finger is on F# on the D string 4th fret, if I stay in position and reach my first finger to G# on the G string, I&#039;m basically depressing the the note with the side of my finger. and I;d rather be using the tip for tone and control. It&#039;s been frustrating me a lot lately.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott, I just started to play yesterday (!) and I&#039;m really enjoying your lessons. I signed up for your mailing list but I was wondering if your lesson archive is in order for someone like me. I feel there is a gap between this lesson and the next (Triads) for example. 
Thank you so much,
Ricardo]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Same height standing as when sitting?  That seems a pretty arbitrary reason to adjust your strap accordingly.  It should start not with sitting posture, but hand, arm and wrist position (as you detail in your other video).  Once the hand, arm and wrist position is good, then then the strap length is good.  It really doesn&#039;t matter whether your standing or sitting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great video, just picked up my first bass, an Ibanez, and am looking forward to learning to play, both with your lessons and a local instructor.  Glad you&#039;re covering the things that are important even before playing/practicing.  Nice dog.

Cheers
