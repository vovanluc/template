		<description><![CDATA[Hello Scott,

Prior to playing electric bass I have played fretless instruments all my life (violin and for a short time upright bass). I find fretless comfortable but I&#039;ve always found the electric bass fingering uncomfortable. Is it ok to use upright fingering on the electric bass or will it be a hinderance down the road? Thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey man! Sounds like you&#039;re over having inlays but I thought I&#039;d mention this...My friend said his inlays were way off on his fretless too. Actually, the bridge saddles are just out of adjustment. The saddles should be positioned in such a way that the 12th fret marker is where it needs to be...then the rest fall into place! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,
I could comment on every video. It&#039;s amazing how much inspiration is within your lessons. I wish you would have been around 20 years ago...well, your lessons rather :). The reason I am commenting here is simply that I would like to add Tony Franklin to your list of Fretless players worth listening to. In the &quot;Hair Days&quot; he was the only guy who dared to play fretless in rock music and I was always impressed with his licks...that&#039;s all. Pino is my personal fave. Thank you again for putting these lessons out there!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Mr Scott,
I&#039;ve recently become interested in bass playing, but I am having a bit of trouble with all these frets always in the way. I&#039;ve played cello for a few years now (which does not have frets), so it is sort of what I am used to. Would you suggest switching to learning fretless bass for now?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott, I just purchased a fretless without line markers.  It has marks on the side of the neck but not on the fretboard.  Your comment about patterns is HUGE.  It isn&#039;t just about hitting the line markers it is patterns too!  Long story short - I&#039;m sending it back... I already have enough basses (including fretless).  Time to just shed, shed and shed some more.  The tone I&#039;m looking for will come from practice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As I&#039;m a bassist who has for years often had to rely on bass guitars that happen to be around, I&#039;d practice on any thing I could get my hands on, I have on occasion found myself with a whole night of jamming ahead of me and only a fretless at my disposal. A lot of fun, I really enjoyed it. I can definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn&#039;t tried one but I certainly need my lines for guides. It&#039;s as close as I have got to a stand up, for which I can only admire from a distance at the moment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott: Lovely bass.  Lovely tone. Lovely playing.  I have several basses, one of which is a fretless.  Pretty much solid Mahogany with Curly Sycamore front, Ebony fingerboard.  I have been using ground wound strings - mostly to save the fingerboard.  But wonder if round wound strings would give that buzz so obvious on your Overwater.  Any thoughts on that?  What would you recommend?]]></description>

I used to play with my brother who played guitar, but he is gone now... Anyway, your lessons are awesome... especially your Jaco lesson and the shapes ones... Thank you... So inspiring..  It is so much more fun to play when you can play well, and you are helping me on that road.]]></description>
