		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, I&#039;m so glad you did this, I&#039;ve been trying to convince the fella&#039;s I&#039;m working with to set up as you suggest, and now I have something to share with them which explains it in very good detail why. Hopefully they will see the light because it is best to always have the bass next to the high hat. I&#039;ve know this since I was 16 and I&#039;m 55 now, I&#039;m wondering why they haven&#039;t locked into this idea long ago. Oh well!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One lesson I&#039;ve learned, is to setup where I can see either the drummers foot, or snare hand, preferably both. ( and I do prefer hi-hat side).  Our band teacher in marching band drilled into us that when you play to the beat you hear, you&#039;re late.  (The time it takes for a drum hit to cross an american football field is enormous).  When things get dicey I watch the drummer hit.  It really is much more precise than just hearing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Move the drums. Set up the drums on the left of the stage and kinda kitty corner them and bring your mic stand back some. in my opinion this set up also looks better, the drummers not as much in the back round and it gives the illusion of more room up there. Also makes it feel more like the jam room.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I play metal with a drummer who uses triggers, so don&#039;t need drums in my monitor (guitar and vocals only with my amp usually behind me normally).

But before seeing this video, I think I always found myself by the high-hat ... a conspiracy of the band, perhaps. 

Thanks as always for the great vid!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,

I&#039;m allways at the hi-hat side of the drummer. My amp is also on that side.
Only when you are on a big stage with only one backline, (allways for right handed drummers, my drummer is left-handed ), then you need to play more with the monitors, I then, stand in front of the drummer, so we have good contact.
Thnx for the lessons, see you..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,Thanks for the tip.I like to set up on the High Hat side also.Unless I am singing Lead vocal at the time,being tucked back with the Drummer is the Catbird seat as far as I am concerned.The last Band I was in had a Johnny come lately Drummer,He was the last to show up and the last to leave the Gig.Setting up was always a challenge with this Guy.Love Your lessons,Thanks..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good advice, in my previous band we had a rather shy guitarist so I found myself standing out front &#038; interacting with our female vocalist rather than the drummer.

Now joined a new outfit so will follow your guidance]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tell ya what if you&#039;ve played with the band for any length of time then you already know where you are in the stage plot . Anyhow I always lock in to the bass drum and Hi hat using the snare as a unison accent. As per which side I&#039;ve played on both sides and as long as I can see  and hear the drummer then its good.!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great advice, Scott, thanks.  

I find the big key to not drifting tempo is a good sharp offbeat from someone.

I usually play in small bands with no drummer and often use my amp for backline and FoH instead of the small PAs often provided, and I&#039;ve found placing the amp to the side of me or slightly forward or back depending on the venue and sound balance is the best compromise then.  But I&#039;m also acutely aware of the sound delay effect caused by the speed of sound if anyone&#039;s more than about 5m away from the sound source, having had real trouble at a recording session over this.

Any comments?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this &#038; all your other lessons. I&#039;ve been playing 30+ years and still find there&#039;s always more to learn.
I find myself playing in a lot of awful rooms with concrete floors &#038; terrible acoustics, and bugger-all monitoring. Consequently I want to be able to see the drummer as well as hear the drummer, and because I&#039;m right-handed and play upright as well as electric I always aim to be on the drummer&#039;s right-hand side. That way if I can&#039;t hear anything I can at least look over my fingerboard.
What is it with cafes and their concrete floors? Bring back carpet!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott,

Thank you for the videos! They are all very useful! 

I usually stand in front of the drummer because I also sing in the ensemble. 

Greetings from Hungary!]]></description>
