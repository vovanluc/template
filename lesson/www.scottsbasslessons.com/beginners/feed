				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a LOT of scales, right? - I think we all know that. </p>
<p>And, I think we can also admit that it can be totally overwhelming knowing which one to learn next, which one will be most useful to us for where we're at right now as a bass player... and in some cases, just how to use scales in a practical and musical way... </p>
<p>Well, check this out...</p>
<p>In this new video, I'm going to show you the only 5 scales you'll ever need to learn!   </p>
<p>Sound crazy? Well, there's method behind the madness ;) </p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>I’ve been playing bass now for around 20 years, which has been long enough for me to hear about every bizarre myth there is when it comes to learning the bass…</p>
<p>I thought it’d be fun to film a quick video for you focusing on some of the most common ones… in fact, my top 5!</p>
<p>The unfortunate thing is that these common myths can actually do damage to your progression as a bassist as they can make you doubt yourself, or simply throw you off the right track. Hopefully this video will help you focus on what’s actually important - hard work, practice, keeping inspired, and enjoying every minute of it.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. And for giggles… here are my top 5 myths that are NOT related to bass playing… <b>(for the bass version watch the video!)</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Humans use only 10% of their brains</li>
<li>Thomas Edison invented the lightbulb</li>
<li>There is no gravity in space</li>
<li>If you shave your hair, it returns thicker and faster (are you kidding me, lol!)</li>
<li>The great wall of China is the only man-made structure visible from space</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway… enough of those shenanigans… check out the video for the top 5 myths about learning bass!</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>Hey, Scott here...</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to cover a topic that pretty much <em>everyone</em> struggles with...</p>
<p><em>"How to learn the notes of the neck?!"</em></p>
<p>Don't worry... I had the same issues as you.</p>
<p>I struggled to memorise where the notes were, and I also got stuck within the first 5 frets and couldn't seem to move out of that area with confidence.</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to show you some great exercises to not only help you memorise the notes of the fingerboard - but also get out of those first 5 frets, with confidence!</p>
<p>I'm also going to tell you exactly what my thought process is when playing grooves or soloing... and weirdly, it's <em>NOT</em> notes... sounds strange, right?</p>
<p>Well, I reveal all in this lesson.</p>
<p><strong>In this lesson you're going to learn:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Why you should start vocalising the note names</li>
<li>How to get out of the "first 5 frets" trap</li>
<li>Using memorised patterns to help with note memorisation</li>
<li>My exact thought process when grooving or soloing on the bass</li>
<li>And as always, way more...</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready? Let's do this!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<p>To really push your playing to the next level, being able to <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/how-to-unlock-your-bass-fingerboard-epic-scale-exercise.html" target="_blank">visualise the available chord tones</a> (arpeggios) and scales around the neck at the drop of a hat is what you should be aiming for. It's going to take some work and dedication, but if you keep consistently practicing exercises such as the one you're going to learn in this lesson - you'll get there.</p>
<p>In this lesson you'll be learning an exercise that will show you an easy way to start gaining more freedom and better visualisation around the fretboard by simply mixing your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/unlock-fretboard-must-see-lesson-bass-players.html" target="_blank">arpeggio patterns</a> - i.e. by not playing the same ascending and descending patterns within the same pass.</p>
<p>The concept is actually super simple... but like with most things, it's sometimes the simplest things that can make the biggest differences.</p>
<p>Hey, and if your a more advanced player... don't worry... this exercise will certainly keep you on your toes too ;)</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. Groove on!</p>

<p>Before you get rolling with this exercise - <em>take it slowly</em>.</p>
<p>It's not about how fast you can play it, it's about making sure you're playing the <em>correct notes</em>.</p>
<p>Another fantastic thing to add to this exercise is to say the note names out loud as you play them. It's tough - but take it slow and you'll get it!</p>

<p>
<p>===</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I published a lesson called “<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/6-common-mistakes-made-by-bass-players-and-how-to-avoid-them.html" target="_blank">The 6 Common Mistakes Made by Bass Players and How to Avoid Them</a>”… and to say the response to that lesson has been amazing would be an understatement!</p>
<p>In just 4 weeks it had reached over <strong>150,000 views on YouTube</strong>, and had 100’s of great comments too.</p>
<p>So, I thought it’d be fun to put another spin on this style of lesson and create<em> “The 10 Things Every Bass Player Should Know”.</em></p>
<h1>Lesson Summary</h1>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1.</strong> <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/rythm/bass-groove-lesson.html" target="_blank">Groove and great time</a> over everything else - make sure you’re working constantly on your own <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/rythm/how-bass-players-interact-with-drummers-being-conversational-with-the-kick-drum.html" target="_blank">rhythmical development</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2.</strong> To get better you need to practice, but - you need to <em>practice</em> practicing - i.e. it’s not easy when you first start out - you need to build this into your routine, and more importantly it needs to become a <em>habit</em>!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3.</strong> You need to know exactly what to practice - this is like having a map.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Wherever you are in the world, you could get to my house if I simply gave you my address. Now, if I asked you to get to my house but didn’t tell you my address, or even which country I lived in - it would be impossible, or at least take you 10,000 times longer. Practising an instrument is the same - you need some sort of map and goal - without it, you can literally waste years practising the wrong things.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4.</strong> You need to know how the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/using-pedal-points-bass-lesson.html" target="_blank">instruments within a band interact</a> with each other - for bass players, knowing how to interact with a drummer is paramount.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>5.</strong> You need to know every note on the fretboard - no excuses.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>6.</strong> You need to have a good knowledge of functional harmony - <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/major-scale-bass.html" target="_blank">scales</a>, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/mastering-your-bass-fingerboard.html" target="_blank">arpeggios</a>, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/chords/playing-chords-on-bass-lesson.html" target="_blank">chords</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>7.</strong> You must know that your ears are your most valuable tool.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>8.</strong> You must know that transcribing is a huge part of your development as a bass player.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>9.</strong> You can’t know a song well enough - know the bass line, know the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/chords/chord-voicing-lesson-for-bass-players.html" target="_blank">structure of the chords</a>, know the melody - don’t just learn the bass line and leave it at that.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>10.</strong> <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/beginners/the-most-important-bass-lesson-i-ever-teach.html" target="_blank">Mindset is absolutely key</a> to everything you do on the bass! If you don’t have the right mindset, turning up to the shed every day will be incredibly hard.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So first of all just let me come clean - I did not come up with this concept. It was shown to me by the amazing bass player Gary Willis, who I was lucky enough to study with many years ago.</p>
<p>Gary is very <em>'visual'</em> in the way he maps out the fretboard - and that was great for me, as I'm also a very visual learner. I absolutely do not have a million note names flying through my head while I'm playing... my thought process is this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1.</strong> What's the root note of the moment?<br />
<strong>2.</strong> What's the quality of the chord? i.e. major 7th, minor 7th, dominant 7th etc etc</p>
<p>I then assign the correct <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/unlock-fretboard-must-see-lesson-bass-players.html" target="_blank">arpeggio</a> (or scale if relevant) shape to the root note.</p>
<p>I have multiple <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/major-scale-bass.html" target="_blank">arpeggio/scale</a> fingering patterns memorised, approximately 3 for each <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/chords/playing-chords-on-bass-getting-your-voice-leading-together.html" target="_blank">chord type</a>, which gives me the ability to have the 'correct shape' under my fingerings wherever I am on the fingerboard, regardless of what the chord type is.</p>
<p>If you want to find out about this in greater detail, you should check out my full <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy/online-bass-courses/harmonic-layering-arpeggios-chord-tones-scales" target="_blank">scales and arpeggio course</a> as it's over 10+ hours long and takes you through a comprehensive step by step approach of how to map out the arpeggios and scales in this way.</p>
<p><em><strong>So what's the big secret?...</strong></em></p>
<p>What helps me tie all of this knowledge together is the <em>4+2 positioning concept</em> that I'm going to show you in this lesson.</p>
<p>The 4+2 fingering concept is a fantastic way of mapping out your key centres on the fingerboard, and organising the huge amount of information we have to deal with when playing into more manageable chunks.</p>
<p>If you use and practice this concept <em>the correct way</em> (as I'm about to show you in this lesson), it will also help you greatly in learning where all the notes of the fingerboard are.</p>
<p>So without further a due, let's jump into this lesson!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ed Friedland is not only one of my favourite bass educators in the world - he's also a fantastic bass player and one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet. In one of his recent live seminars within the Academy he was asked a great question... <em>"What constitutes a great bass player?"</em></p>
<p>Now take a moment and think about that question.</p>
<p>It's actually much more complex than it first seems - and, is absolutely relevant to all of us.</p>
<p>I this video Ed shares what he thinks makes a great bass player. And personally, I don't think anyone could have given a better answer.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. Remember that Ed, and many more of the best bass educators in the world do completely live online streamed seminars <em>every week</em> in the Academy.

<p>BB King, Eric Clapton, Steely Dan, Boz Scaggs, Jimi Hendrix, even The Roots have all used the shuffle feel...</p>
<p>It's one of the most important and popular feels in music today - and therefore, it's absolutely vital that we have this feel completely mastered!</p>
<p>The shuffle feel is also very flexible in its application. There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npRh8JassTk" target="_blank">traditional</a> shuffle feels, right through to the <a href="https://youtu.be/9t0VlzJeNvA?t=1m27s" target="_blank">Purdie Shuffle</a>, and everything in-between.</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to show you 2 great exercises to help you start fine tuning your shuffle!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

<p>Great rhythm is absolutely vital to us as bass players and musicians. It's the one fundamental factor of everything we play.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you can <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/beginners/slap-bass-getting-started.html">slap</a> a thousand notes a minute. It doesn't matter if you can <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/play-multiple-octave-scales-like-bad-ass.html">solo</a> around a complex <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/how-to-play-out-when-soloing-on-bass.html">jazz</a> tune at 300bpm.</p>
<p>It ALL comes down to rhythm. And if you your rhythmical internalisation is off - <em>everything</em> you play will be off.</p>
<p>Now, many people believe that great rhythmical sensibility is something you're born with and that it can't be learned and developed. Well, I say that's absolute rubbish!</p>
<p>Rhythm can be developed. <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/danny-mo-morris-r-b-bass-lesson.html">Groove</a> can be developed. And, your overall sense of time can be developed.</p>
<p>Just like when learning any skill - you just need to be given the right <em>information</em>, at the right <em>time</em>, and then <em>apply it</em>.</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to show you a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/using-pedal-points-bass-lesson.html">great groove</a> exercise to strengthen your rhythmical internalisation.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If your anything like me when practising, most of the time you'll be sitting down. This makes total sense, as if we're going to be making any serious progress we're going to be spending <em>a lot</em> of time with our bass - and if we were to be stood up the entire time it could lead to various back problems. I can name countless bass players that have serious back and shoulder issues - <em>this stuff is serious</em> - so please don't take this lightly.</p>
<p>It's easy to assume that sitting down when practicing is simple, but it's actually quite deceptive. I've worked with countless students that needed to alter the was they were sitting. One little change can give you way more facility and freedom on the fingerboard - simply by altering the angle of your bass.</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to show you exactly how I make sure I've got the correct positioning and few cool tricks to help you do the same.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As bass players we’re constantly playing up and down the fingerboard and changing positions as our bass lines, grooves and solos dictate. One of the most common mistakes I see students make time and time again when making these <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/speed-shifting-exercises-bass-lesson.html" target="_blank">fingerboard shifts</a> or going for larger jumps on the fingerboard is where their attention is focused<em> at the exact moment of the shift</em>.</p>
<p>Most of the time players are so consumed with what their fretting hand is doing, that when shifting to a new position they’re still focused solely on their <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/2-great-tips-perfect-fretting-hand-technique.html" target="_blank">fretting hand</a> - <em>and not where they’re about to shift to.</em> This is exactly what leads to floppy shifts, landing on the wrong finger, and more often that not even landing on the wrong fret!</p>
<p>In this lesson I’m going to get laser focused on this topic and give you an awesome<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/ear-training-exercise-bass.html" target="_blank"> </a>exercise to break this bad habit for good!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Playing freely up and down the fingerboard and been able to visualise your available notes within any given key can be a real challenge - especially for bass players, as a lot of the time we're playing the <em>money notes</em> in the lower register of the instrument, i.e. the notes we get payed to play! ;) This means that when we venture up into the higher register of the fingerboard, things can get scary - fast!</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to show you a great way to start visualizing your scales upon the fingerboard - in a way that organizes everything into 3 easy to learn patterns, and once learned can be linked up into multiple combinations to achieve total freedom when playing over the entire fingerboard.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
