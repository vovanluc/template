		<description><![CDATA[Hi, nice channel and great info. I just ordered a &quot;factory refurbished&quot; Fender Squire Vintage Modified bass guitar and I noticed that the A string sound kind of dead or dull compared to the other string which sound louder, brighter, slinkier. Do you have any idea what this could be? I ordered some new strings just in case but it&#039;s got me worried that something might be wrong with it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This does help &quot; revitalize the old strings.... To a point, it will clean the dirt and finger oils off of them and return some not all of their original brightness. I have also had success adding in just a 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda, not powder but soda, this will help clean them up. The refreshing wont last nearly as long as a new set, but in a pinch will do the trick at least for a gig.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks scott, just bought my first bass, which was a new old stock with the original 5 year old strings still on it. I got a fresh set of strings with it, but was scared to restring it myself. Your video gave me enough confidence to do it, even though its very scary to cut through your strings. Everything worked out nice and playing my new strings now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Like most folks getting a little more life out of my strings helps my pocket funds. I&#039;ve had noticeable success boiling strings. Simply put all the strings into a small pot and bring to a boil 3 to 5 minutes. Distilled water would be best. Nothing more. Dry and re-string. You will need to recheck your setup because of removing all the strings. It works for me until I have the cash for new strings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I do not clip my strings because i heard of people boiling them in hot water which is supposed to revitalize them.
Although i haven&#039;t tried it yet i keep my strings because they don&#039;t come cheap and they come in handy if you snap a string.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, thanks for all the input! I was wondering if you have an advice on the pitch and the bend of the neck itself. For some reason I&#039;m having issues with the E-string vibrating on the first fret when playing further down (7th fret +)... and it started over night.

Thanks a lot.
A big fan of your project]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great advice, as always! 2 questions: I&#039;d always heard you need 3 wraps of the string around the peg. Is that still true, or is that just for certain brands of string? Also, doesn&#039;t pushing down on the string at the saddle and the nut risk loosening the winding? I&#039;ve had strings come unwound in the past (though it was a long time ago).]]></description>
