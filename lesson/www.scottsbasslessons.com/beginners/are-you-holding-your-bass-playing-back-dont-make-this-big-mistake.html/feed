		<description><![CDATA[thanks for the advise! Having a love/ hate relation with my playing,due to a learning disability I make slow progress  and get frustrated by lack of progress! I don&#039;t have the endeavor to become a proffesional Bass player, I enjoy my work as a physiotherapist and bass playing is a hobby for me. With all the info around, even on the site from SBL, there is so much info. I try to concentrate on a few topics but I get distracted by all the info that&#039;s around. I see people on the site setting bigger goals then I, Due to my learning disability  I have to set small goals. It takes more time for me to learn things, seeing other people making faster progress makes me feel embarrassed]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dan, probably you are playing too hard in your right hand as well. Nerves of both extremities are connected. Is quite hard to relax one hand when the other is in great tension. How is the string action of the bass by the way? ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ok well I was afraid to ask but what is the number of your parents&#039; house?  :) Seriously ,  recently  I saw for the first time these lessons online and they are great. Thinking  about if I can have the time to  do the academy.  Having picked up the bass later in life , and being self taught, , I definitely  feel the insecurity of  how many  better players there are who&#039;ve been playing all there life.  So I  have a tough time feeling like I&#039;m &#039;worthy &#039;. Actually I&#039;m feeling  slightly embarrassed even commenting on a bass forum! Yet I love to play and do not plan on stopping .]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So this video inspired me to ask a question! I&#039;ve been teaching myself the bass for about 8 months and I just watched your videos on strap height and hand placement. They were super helpful! Anyway, when I go to play the E string in the &quot;flying fingers&quot; exercise (or in general really) all of my fingers reach comfortably except for my pinky. When I go to play the E string with my pinky, my hand forms into that uncomfortable claw shape and my wrist starts to hurt. Is there anything I can go to fix this, or do I just had bad genetics? Thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve played double bass for 40 years, but I recently began studying electric bass on my own. I&#039;ve signed up for your course, watched many of your videos, and downloaded lots of things from your website. I&#039;ve been working on many aspects of technique, but I wonder if I should just concentrate on one area, e.g., speed, instead of trying to learn chords, scales, transcription, etc. When I studied double bass my teacher would let me know when it was time to move on. Now I&#039;m on my own, and I&#039;m not sure when to go from step one to step two, if you know what I mean. There are so many things to learn besides basic technique. Any advice?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Scott.  I get so busy with my job that I don&#039;t even make the time to watch the videos I download from you.  However, I do plug in my phone to my amp and practice Joe Satriani tunes almost daily, which lasts about 30 minutes until my phone dies.  lol  Anyway, you do give great advice and I absolutely do want to play better, be it christian or jazz or fusion, something that really challenges my level of learning.  I am a teacher by the way, and I guess the next student I should encourage is me.  Thanks bro and God bless!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have always been a very shy person - but few people who know me would 
believe it.  You see, I started as child to compensate for my shyness by
 acting boldly.  The really, really, really important part here is 
&#039;acting!&#039;  When I get up on stage, I just do it because I&#039;m acting like I
 belong there.  You&#039;d never suspect me of being terrified.  But that&#039;s 
just me...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, may be its a bass player thing because I certainly would do the same thing. After playing bass my whole life in that mode I&#039;ve opened up over the last few years and have improved more in that short period than I had in the previous decade. Tools like Scott&#039;s bass are really blessing for the shy person because you can stop rewind, take the time to process without feeling like you are imposing on others. (Thank you for that) But you said it right, if you have a live instructor its best to ask rather than lose the moment and that  knowledge.]]></description>
