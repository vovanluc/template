				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For this weeks Bass Riff of the Week I thought it'd be cool to show you a riff that incorporates harmonics within a groove.</p>
<p>When using harmonics it's more common to incorporate them within a melody line or use them to enhance a lower bass note. You can hear bass players such as Jaco Pastorius doing this with incredible finesse and musicality.</p>
<p>Another more uncommon technique is to use harmonics within an actual groove to flesh out the harmony. It can be technically quite tricky to get the harmonics to continue ringing out while the bass line is being played... but hey, if it were easy it wouldn't be as fun ;)</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

<p>Within the riff I'm going to show you various "Pino-ism's" so you can start to slip them into your own bass lines and grooves until they become a solid part of your own vocabulary.</p>
<p>We're going be looking at left hand muting, double stops, and much more...</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>String skipping is one of those techniques that will constantly trip you up if your technique isn't up to scratch. That's why for this weeks <em>Bass Riff of the Week</em> I've decided to create a riff that incorporates multiple variants of string skipping ideas... essentially so we can get laser focused on this particular movement.</p>
<p>Your aim with this riff should be to get a great feel and overall cleanness while playing the riff, i.e. no strings left un-muted, no strings being caught be accident... but <em>lot's</em> of groove! Once that is achieved you can begin to crank up the speed until you're playing it at the correct tempo with the play-along track.</p>
<p>You can download the play-along track, TAB &amp; notation <strong>directly under the video</strong>.  And, if you’re an SBL Academy member you can also download the full video file so you can watch these lessons offline plus the audio only version too. Not an Academy member yet… <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">check it out here!</a></p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

<p>PS. If you enjoy this lesson and really want to become a "technique ninja" on the bass you should check out our full technique course within the <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy" target="_blank">S.B.L Academy</a>. It’s over 2 hours long and includes the very exercises I developed working with hundreds of students over the years, and ultimately completely changed my bass playing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Muting with the left hand to get a shorter attack from the note and giving your bass lines a more vintage feel, is something I only came across a few years ago.</p>
<p>I originally discovered this technique when watching a video of the great bassist and educator Danny Mo Morris (who's now one of the many world-class educators teaching within the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">SBL Academy</a>), but soon after I saw many bass players using the exact same technique such as the great gospel bass player Sharay Reed and the power house of groove behind the band Tower of Power, Rocco Prestia.</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to show you this cool left hand muting technique in detail, and also tell you how it pretty much saved my bass playing career!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As bass players we have many roles to play within a band or ensemble, and creating a strong foundation and groove needs to be high within our priorities.</p>
<p>At times this can mean staying out of the way harmonically, so the rest of the band can do their thing without the bass line getting in anyone's way by being too busy or harmonically rich.</p>
<p>This is great for the rest of the band, but sometimes this can make you feel un-inventive with your bass lines and grooves... in a way, almost like you can't be a part of the creative harmonic process.</p>
<p>Don't worry, you're not alone... until I found a few little tricks (that i'll show you in the lesson below) I felt the exact same way.</p>
<p>But... there's hope! :)</p>
<p>By using specific intervals on certain chord types we can be harmonically creative with our bass lines without the fear of treading on anyone else's toes within the band or ensemble.</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to take you through which intervals will give you this freedom and the specific chord types they relate too.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Using 10th style chords within my grooves and bass lines is something I've been playing around with lately and it's been great fun! So, I wanted to share it with you and get you using them within your bass lines too.</p>
<p>Before we delve into this weeks riff, I also wanted to share my composition process with you as I get a constant flow of emails asking how I come up with a new riff every week... and, how I'm going to keep coming up with new and original ones every week for the next year (I've vowed to create 52 Bass Riff Of The Week episodes over the next year).</p>
<p>The truth is, I don't just sit and wait for inspiration, that would take too much time... instead, I give myself rules, or at least a set of guide lines. By doing this it gives me the ability to get laser focused on a few different elements and makes the composition process a lot easier.</p>
<p>For instance, a simple set of rules for writing a song could be;</p>
<ul>
<li>It must only contain 3 chords.</li>
<li>The melody line has to be very rhythmical.</li>
<li>The melody line should include large interval jumps.</li>
</ul>
<p>By doing this, it would give the writer something to focus on and narrow down the possible routes they could take. This is a common compositional technique used by many song writers.</p>
<p>My guide lines for this riff were;</p>
<ul>
<li>The riff cannot start on the root of the chord or main key centre.</li>
<li>The riff must contain 10ths.</li>
<li>The riff must be over a funk type groove.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since I started the Bass Riff of the Week series 12 weeks ago I've had loads of requests for a rock style bass riff... so I thought it was about time to get my rocks off ;)</p>
<p>In this lesson you're going to learn about string skipping, my compositional process, and a great way to use the melodic minor scale. Plus you'll learn about why you should watch out for falling branches... don't worry, I reveal everything in the lesson!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Slap bass is undoubtably one of the most popular and recognizable techniques when playing bass so I thought it was about time to get our thumbs out for this weeks Bass Riff of The Week!</p>
<p>The key of E is one of the most popular key centers to create slap riffs around as having the open E within the groove means we can player higher up the neck, but still utilize the low E within the riff. This makes it easier than if the root note was G for instance, as if we wanted to incorporate the low G within the riff we'd most probably have to play the majority of the riff in the lower area of the neck.</p>
<p>I've actually recorded a full lesson on this a few months ago called "Breaking The Mould" <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/slap-bass-lesson-breaking-the-mould.html">that you can check out here</a>. If you want to investigate playing slap riffs in other key centers than E.</p>
<p>That said, I still love to create slap <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/slap-bass-lesson-the-sectret-triplet-technique.html">riffs in E </a>but with this weeks riff I've decided to incorporate some double stop type ideas and also some lines that require you to slap and pop on adjacent strings - and this can be quite tricky if you haven't tried this before.</p>
<p>My aim with this riff is to push you out of your comfort zone and show you that even when a slap riff is in the key of E... it can still be challenging and fun to master.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For this weeks Bass Riff of the Week I've taken elements from two of my influences - Pino Palladino and <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/notes/matt-garrison-god-father-of-the-modern-bass-player.html">Matt Garrison</a>. Both are phenomenal bass players - both have their own unique style and sound and are completely different from each other.</p>
<p>For this weeks riff I've gone for a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/riff-of-the-week/funk-soul-groove-bass-playing.html">"nu-soul"</a> type vibe which is very reminiscent of the D'Angelo sound that can be heard on his album Voodoo (with Pino Palladino taking care of low-end duties).</p>
<p>The riff is based on a two chord vamp (Dm7-Am7) and other than the double stops the riff is built mostly from chord tones derived from the Am7.</p>
<p>The faster solo line at the end of the riff is built around a C major7#11 chord - I fully explain why this works in the video.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Using chromatic approach notes within my bass lines and grooves is one of my favorite techniques. Ever.</p>
<p>To say I use it a lot would be a serious understatement... I use is ALL the time, in pretty much everything I play.</p>
<p>I first picked up on the approach note technique when I was transcribing solos by guys such as Charlie Parker and Miles Davis, but later when transcribing bass players such as <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/palm-muting-lesson.html">James Jamerson</a>, <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/notes/bob-babbitt-interview.html">Bob Babbit</a> and <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/notes/carol-kaye-lesson.html">Carol Kaye </a>I found that they were also using the same technique extensively within their bass lines.</p>
<p>In this weeks bass riff of the week I thought I'd create a riff that was based around the chromatic approach note technique so you could see and hear it in action. I also slipped in a cool descending triadic lick at the end of the groove that was inspired by Michael League, bass player from Snarky Puppy (a band you need to check out if you haven't already!). He uses a lot of triadic ideas within his bass lines, so I've been shedding them over the last few weeks myself as I love the sound of them so much... and they sound killer on my P bass ;)</p>
<p>You can download the full TAB and notation by hitting the link directly under the video... plus you'll get the play-along track too.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. I also just wanted to say a massive thanks to all of you that left the amazing feedback about the solo bass singles I've released over the last few weeks. Reading your comments totally blew me away! :)</p>
<p>If you haven't heard them yet, you can hear "smile" <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/live-sessions/scotts-solo-bass-sessions-smile-charlie-chaplin.html">here</a>... and "Autumn Leaves" <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/live-sessions/scotts-solo-bass-sessions-autumn-leaves.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>I've received a ton of email since the <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/live-sessions/scotts-solo-bass-sessions-smile-charlie-chaplin.html">first single</a> was released asking whether I'd ever be creating a course covering how to play chords on the bass and how to master chordal arrangement. Well... the simple answer is... yes I will!</p>
<p>I'll be releasing a full course covering chords into <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">The Academy</a> at the end of November. If you're already an Academy member this course will be added to your membership automatically as soon as it's released. If you're not already a member... shoot <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">over here</a> and check out <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">The Academy</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"The Twister"... weird name, right?</p>
<p>This Bass Riff of The Week uses short 4 note groupings played one after the other. Because the rest between each 4 note grouping remains the same length throughout the riff, it gives the phrasing of it that "over the bar line" feel - hence the name, "The Twister". Try playing it and you'll see what I mean.</p>
<p>The first time I heard compositional devises such as this being used was while listening to the band Dream Theatre (many moons ago when I was a nipper... although I still love them now). They also use this kind of approach in odd time signatures too... that's when things get really fun! :)</p>
<p>As with all of these riffs, start off slow. The key is to get a clean <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/unhappy-with-your-technique-watch-this-l99.html" target="_blank">technique</a> when playing the riff slowly, and then slowly crank up the speed bit by bit until you can play it up to tempo.</p>
<p>You can download the full TAB and notation by hitting the link directly under the video... plus you'll get the play-along track too.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last weeks bass riff of the week was such a monster to understand and get your fingers around I thought I'd better create a bit of an "explainer video" for you so you can fully understand what was going on.</p>
<p>It sounds pretty complex, but is easier than you might think...</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to break down the concept of using "stacked fifths" type shapes like I used to create "The Bass Riff of Doom", and show you how to get different extensions such as 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths by simply moving the shape around the fretboard.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So first, let me prepare you...</p>
<p>This week's Bass Riff of the Week is a <em>real stinker</em> to play, hence the name.</p>
<p>I was actually going to call it "The Ball Breaker" but that name was vetoed by Geoff (community manager inside the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">S.B.L Academy</a> and overall bass bad-ass) and my wife.</p>
<p>And, in these situations they're generally right so I settled on "The Bass Riff of Doom" ;)</p>
<p>The riff itself was inspired by Sibylline who's one of our <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">Academy</a> members. She's been working hard to get her singing and bass playing synced up, and has been checking out some old Police songs to act as "study pieces". This prompted me to have a "Police revival month".</p>
<p>One of my favorite Police songs of all time is "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbXWrmQW-OE">Message in a Bottle</a>". It's a great song in itself, but it was also the first time I'd heard the root-fifth-ninth interval movement being used to such an extent. The verse of Message in a Bottle is based around four chords, and the guitar riff is playing the root-fifth-ninth intervals of each of those chords within the sequence.</p>
<p>For this bass riff of the week I decided to expand on this idea, but instead of using multiple chords I have a sustained Em9 that I substitute multiple stacked fifth patterns (root-5th-9th) over the top of.</p>
<p>The end result is a really cool sounding riff... but, it's a little tough to get your fingers around at first because of the stretches and slides between some of the notes. Hence the name - "The Bass Riff of Doom".</p>
<p>Make sure you download the workbook including the full TAB and notation as you'll be able to see exactly where I'm using slides to get from one shape to the next - this is essential when it comes to playing this riff up to speed.</p>
<p>Until next week, take it easy... and I'll see you in the shed!<br />
As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week i’ve been on a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQE5vwlRYHA">Tower of Power</a>” listening marathon so I thought it would be fitting to model this weeks bass riff around a funk feel with a 16th note groove to it.</p>
<p>If you haven’t heard T.O.P before, you need to come and join the party… these guys are one of the funkiest bands on the planet, and happen to have one of the tightest rhythm sections you’ll have ever heard - the one and only Rocco Prestia on bass and David Garibaldi on drums.</p>
<p>To hear Rocco and David in action, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04P5_AGMu3M">check this out</a>.</p>
<p>Ok, let’s look at the riff.</p>
<p>This weeks riff is based around a D dominant 7th sound with a few sneaky chromatic notes added here and there to spice things up a little. If you’re not sure what a “D Dominant 7th” is don’t sweat it, I run through it in this lesson. But as a caveat, if you’re not working on your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">chord tones or arpeggios</a> yet, you’re going to need to start prioritising them within your practice time as they are the harmonic foundation of everything you’ll play as a bass player. They are an essential part of the language, and to get your bass playing to the next level understanding them and being able to use them is a must.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this weeks "Bass Riff of the Week" i'm getting my thumb out and going Gospel!</p>
<p>Last week during a live Q&amp;A masterclasses that we run bi-weekly within the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/sbl-insider-pro">SBL Academy</a>, one of our members was having problems getting a clean slap technique. He could slap the E string with no problems whatsoever, but as soon as he started slapping the A, D or G strings he started getting unwanted noise as the other strings would ring out uncontrollably. He also found the overall volume of the these strings to be quieter than the E string too.</p>
<p>These are all very common problems and something i'm sure you might have had a problem with either in the past, or it might be something you're struggling with right now. In our live Q&amp;A session I advised him that the best way to start working on these issues was to take a repeated riff that used all the strings, and then simply start working on this riff really slowly over an extended period of time, looking in-depth at each individual movement until it can be played cleanly with the same overall volume on each string.</p>
<p>I thought the bass riff I came up with during our Q&amp;A session was pretty cool... so I thought i'd use it for this weeks "Bass Riff of the Week".</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
