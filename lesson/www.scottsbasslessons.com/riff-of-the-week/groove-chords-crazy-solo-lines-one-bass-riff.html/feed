		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Scott!
I think these riffs of the week are just getting better and better. They are fast becoming my favorite learning resource.
Great description of why it works and your breakdown changed my thinking from &quot;I&#039;ll never manage that&quot; to &quot;maybe I can do this&quot;.
Nice one :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott! Thanks, amazing like always! 

I have a suggestion. A favor to ask actually. I think some of us will benefit from seeing your right hand a bit more. It seems to me that generally right hand fingering is treated more in a &quot;you&#039;ll figure it out!&quot; fashion (not only here, in general). We do figure something out, most of the times, but it&#039;s also good to see what you do! Especially for me speed is an issue, and in such fast arpeggios I sometimes wanna see which notes to hammer on and which ones to actually pluck. Thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A couple of riffs ago I asked if you could articulate more with your fretting hand to make it easier to see what&#039;s going on particularly in the slower versions. It seems to me you&#039;re really trying to do that now so I for one would like to say thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome Riff of Week Scott &#038; team, so far my favorite one. But I think I say that after each one. Love the format on this one you keep making them better &#038; better. I&#039;m sorry but that bass sounds so incredible even without articulation, love it. Is there any drills or tips you can give to keep that A ringing when you hit that B &#038; C on the double stop. Seems like my finger are too short and I mute the A. Thanks a bunch and keep up all the great work!

Cheers]]></description>
