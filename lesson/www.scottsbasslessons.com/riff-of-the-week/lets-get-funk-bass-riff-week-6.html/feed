		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, another great riff, thanks. 

But if I have one minor complaint it&#039;s that I find I need to watch these videos backwards. e.g. Once I&#039;ve watched (and heard) you play the riff at full speed, I then need to skip forward to the riff &quot;breakdown&quot; and then the version played slowly, then skip back to the slightly faster version and then finally to the full speed version. 

Not sure what everyone else thinks, but for me, I&#039;d prefer you did the full speed demo, then the breakdown and play through at say 75 B.P.I, next a little faster and finally at full speed again, this just gives a chance to 
1: Hear the riff - 
2: learn the riff - 
3: play the riff slowly - 
4: play it a little faster and get up to speed - 
5: jam the riff at full speed. 

Just a thought. 
Cheers, Kanga.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great and cool Scott. What about a blues riff ? By the way nice posters behind you, and a kind of &quot;behind the scene&quot; of your videos would be a great idea. Great job from you and your team. Cheers :-)]]></description>
