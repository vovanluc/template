		<description><![CDATA[Good stuff! Nice format. I would VERY MUCH like an in-depth video breaking down Joe Dart&#039;s style and how to write bass-lines that have that same James-Jamerson style sound. Maybe start with an easier lesson for the bassics of the style and then have more intermediate and advanced lessons for some of Joe&#039;s crazier stuff. Thank you for holdin&#039; it down!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t read all the comments, so understand and agree with those about your usual efforts, but this seems more of an &quot;on the fly, let me share it&quot; short format.  &lt;B&gt;IT&#039;S A COOL ADDITION&lt;/B&gt;, please post them at will.  

I have always wanted to join, but I used to be lucky to get the time for 20 minutes a week.  No exceptional reasons, just life, work, wife, children etc.  I picked up a Vox amPlug 2 so as to be more quiet at home; if my wife hears my bass the reaction &quot;oh, you&#039;re not busy?&quot;  I&#039;ve even brought just the bass to the &quot;loo&quot; with me (TMI and apologies if any mental visuals adversely effect the rest of anyone&#039;s day). I do end up having luck when my youngest (20 mos) gets into it since, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; I enjoy him enjoying it and &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt; I can get away with playing it up for a bit (forget about any pedals, he&#039;s into changing it up &lt;i&gt;thanks kid&lt;/i&gt;).

I&#039;ve taken to bringing my bass, 2-in-1 tablet and amPlug to work usually every day and am able to get in 40 to 50 minutes at lunch (screw eating and I love to eat) 5 days a week; as much as I enjoy the &quot;usual&quot; format, this one is perfect.  I usually play by ear (don&#039;t read, self taught since a young teenager with a gap of 20(?) years in there), but with this format what I find the most useful if matching your use of the fretboard rather than other places I can go (once I&#039;m down, down, down with this I&#039;ll flutz around with it).  About 15 minutes with it the first day and then I spent roughly 30-40 minutes yesterday; I&#039;ve got it and do the &quot;middle&quot; run-through along with you, but at the proper tempo I almost dislocate a few fingers, bite my elbow and buck a tooth with my knee; no rush, I&#039;ll get there soon enough.

To get it right on, I slowed the video down to 0.5, which makes the initial fingering much easier; I do appreciate the slow play through and the fact that you have to tame the &quot;funk&quot; running through the veins/nerve endings to keep it plain and simple &lt;b&gt;but&lt;/b&gt; you can&#039;t remove it all, which I understand; 0.5 speed pretty much clears up any accidental, overt pleasure with a groove.  My wife loves busting my b, a, double L, s when fairly continuous movement takes place on the neck when notes aren&#039;t being played &lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt; I am aware of at least two references to &quot;the wife,&quot; and feel the need to explain that this has nothing to do with any kind of being &quot;whipped&quot; by female anatomy in the lower abdominal region; to clarify this is not the case, she scares me.

Please do continue this.  I believe those that are &quot;missing&quot; tab/notation etc., will find a use for it and look forward to additional postings like it.  Lastly (you&#039;re lucky I&#039;m not talking and can just read this, bass gets me all ramped up and lunch is still 2 hours off); if in the morning &quot;over the din of (&lt;b&gt;y&lt;/b&gt;)our Rice Krispies&quot; a groove grabs you, I say &quot;&lt;i&gt;share it&lt;/i&gt;&quot; man!!!

Thanks for all you do.  I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if you could teach the tone deaf and &quot;toe tapping&quot; deficient to play.

		<description><![CDATA[I love the format! I think the fact that you perform the riff at a slower tempo, but not super slow, helps challenge us as musicians (if you&#039;re trying to play the riff without getting the notation)! All in all, I love it! Would be excited to see more of these videos 😄!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Best. Lesson. Ever.
Fast, then slowed down, and plenty of repeats to play along with. Awesome.

I see a few people are asking about the chord progression etc.
Maybe do a lesson on key signatures and reading music Scott?
I found the notation (almost) as instructive as the video in this instance!

MOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRREEEE!!!!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I love the efficiency of the format and the ear training this kind of lesson is! But a couple of (written) contextual elements would be helpfull to start with a better grip (tempo, key tone, beggining and end of the riff when you play it in loop). If you need it you have it, if you don&#039;t it doesn&#039;t get in your way nor slows the lesson.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love it, The only thing i really think is missing that i love your analysis of the chord structure. I find it really helps when i understand it deeply without questioning myself. It seems to expand my playing when I fully understand the note choices. For example the A#, F#, C# (is it an F# passing chord..? is that a thing?).. and the last little lick right at the end.. I love it.. just want to know which bits are the leading note etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Short lesson format great for getting to the meat and potatoes of it... good ear training too though you can also use your eyes especially in the slow down section.. Terrific riff/groove brought to life with your use of dead notes and string slaps not played in the slow bit. Never heard of Joe Dart until seeing this - I have now! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Loved this, for the next quick riff I would like to see an eight bar turn-around to add to this to make it a complete song. A tip that I just learned that may be helpful to others is, if you open this in Youtube with Google chrome and press the little gear-looking thing in the lower right hand corner, and select speed, you can slow it down. This will make it easier to watch the fingering, and if you need tab, (like me) you can write it out. Just a tip, use pencil  so you can correct your mistakes, what you think you see may be wrong when you play it. This was a great ear training lesson, I am an old beginner just starting to get my ears together.]]></description>
