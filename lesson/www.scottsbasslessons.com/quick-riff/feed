<p>===</p>
<p>I'm sure you've heard Sir Duke by Stevie Wonder (if you haven't, go listen to it now!)...</p>
<p>There's an awesome unison line where the bass doubles up with the horns to produce what's got to be one of the coolest and most memorable unison lines in funk history. </p>
<p>I see soooo many bass players struggling with this particular unison line. </p>
<p>They either play it in the wrong position or use incorrect fingering (which can make it impossible to play cleanly), so I thought it'd be cool to create a "quick riff" style lesson for you, so you can see exactly how I tackle this tricky line.</p>
<p>And remember, if you're an Academy member you also get instant access to the full analysis video where I break things down piece by piece and discuss the theory and harmony too. </p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<p>In this quick riff style lesson you're going to learn a super cool Pino Palladino style groove... with a few little twists of my own in there too ;) </p>
<p>It's based on an E dominant 7th tonality with a good dose of gospel... look out for the cool fill I use that spans the entire fingerboard... it's super fun! </p>
<p>And remember, if you're an Academy member you also get instant access to the full analysis video for this riff where I break it down piece by piece and discuss the theory and harmony behind it too. </p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

<p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Years ago I was watching a Robin Ford tutorial video (yep, video... VHS... old school!). Within the video he started explaining the concept of using diminished arpeggios up a half step from the root of any dominant chord... my mind was blown!</p>
<p>It was a pretty simple thing to do - and it made me sound as if I knew what I was doing... even better! ;) </p>
<p>So, I thought it'd be fun to incorporate this harmonic technique in this new Quick Riff lesson. </p>
<p>This Quick Riff is based around a A dominant 7th tonality and incorporates the Bb diminished arpeggio which is  superimposed over the A7 within the line. </p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong><br />
We've had amazing feedback about the Quick Riff and Lick videos that we've been publishing over the last few months. The overwhelming verdict has been that you guys LOVE short, bite -size videos that are quick and easy to consume...</p>
<p>But... I also think that understanding 'how' and 'why' these riffs  and licks are built and applied from a theoretical stand point is also super important. When you understand the theory behind these riffs and licks you can take them and apply them in many different situations... essentially, really soak them up into your own vocabulary. </p>
<p>That's why I've decided to add an exciting new feature to The Academy...</p>
<p>Now, for every Quick Riff or Lick I publish, Academy members will also get a full analysis lesson. Within each analysis I will break the riff or lick down, piece by piece, and show you the underlying theory behind what I'm playing and exactly why it works, which means that you'll be able to take that information and start using it within your own bass lines, grooves and solos. </p>
<p>Now... it's time to dive into the lesson and get some funk on! ;) </p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. If you haven't already heard... iBass Magazine (one of the coolest digital magazines out there) is coming into the Scott's Bass Lessons family from July onwards! </p>
<p>In a nutshell, we're going to be putting the full SBL force behind iBass Magazine and totally re-imagine what a monthly, digital magazine can be. I'm talking behind the scenes video interviews with some of the biggest bass names on the planet, news, reviews, lessons and play-along... the full nine yards! </p>
<p>Our first official SBL publication of iBass Magazine is coming out on July 1st and it's featuring none other than Will Lee on the cover... plus, we'll be offering a crazzzzy special deal during the launch period.</p>
<p>To get notified when the first publication rolls out and get the special deal that we'll be offering (you won't want to miss this one!), <a href="http://ibassmag.com/" target="_blank">click here and get on the early bird list today.</a></p>

<p>After all the amazing feedback from the last <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/joe-dart-quick-riff-l193.html" target="_blank">Quick Riff lesson</a> I released, I figured it was time for a new one!</p>
<p>... and for this riff you'll need to get your thumb out! ;)</p>
<p>The inspiration for this riff came from one of my favourite bass players of all time, the amazing Victor Bailey.</p>
<p>Victor is unfortunately going through some incredibly hard times right now and is suffering from a rare form of muscular dystrophy called Charcot Marie Tooth disease, so wherever you are in the world, make sure to send all your bass love, thoughts and support to Victor and wish him well.</p>
<p>You can find out more about Victor's condition by <a href="https://www.youcaring.com/victor-bailey-462309" target="_blank">clicking here.</a></p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

<p>Ok, I wanted to try a new style of lesson out and your feedback would really help me out...</p>
<p>This new lesson format is super short, and easy to digest. It won't replace my usual lessons - maybe it's just a cool edition to what I usually create... who knows?!</p>
<p>That's where you come in!...</p>
<p>Check the lesson out... learn the riff (it's seriously funky!)... and then in the comments let me know what you think about this style of lesson.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
