		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, it was great to hear your history.  It&#039;s not unlike many other professionals stories I&#039;ve heard and if I may paraphrase:- If one wants to be a musician, practice, seek knowledge and practice more.  But if you want to be a professional musician one needs to work and that requires contacts, so also get a job in the music industry, an instrument shop, wholesaler or manufacturer, a booking agency or recording studio.  You will meet other musicians and one day you&#039;ll get an offer.  Even if you don&#039;t think you&#039;re ready, take it!  You&#039;ll learn quickly on the job and make more contacts, from which you&#039;ll get more work.]]></description>

What do ppl think?]]></description>
