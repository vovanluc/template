		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott,

I like the look of that Overwater Expression semi acoustic bass. I see you did a quick demo video a couple years back. I was unable to view it or find any other video where I can hear that bass. Do you think we could get a nice video showing us that bass please?

Thanks again,
Mike]]></description>
