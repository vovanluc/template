		<description><![CDATA[Am I &quot;unclean&quot; in some way because my highest ambition is to learn Bass riffs to my favorite songs by TAB?  I&#039;m an old man with a Great Fender Aerodyne Bass?  Most of you will surpass my abilities and skill in about 20 minutes.......I&#039;m 70......I love the Bass and it&#039;s place in music more than anyone I know....including those who have a lot of life and time and passion to spend.  All I can ever hope for is the most basic of basics, but I have a firm grasp of who and what I&#039;m capable of, ( very little).  I&#039;ve had Fender Fever since I was 14 years old......1960.  Still, I smile every time I hear a Bassline, and am as happy to hear it as the Best of the Best.......JPR]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am writing this as a member of the SBL Academy since May 2014.


I have been meaning to write this little homage for a while now. Or rather, I have been thinking along these lines for quite some time, and recently begun to feel that I really ought to let Scott know how I - and probably all of us - feel. &quot;Credit where credit is due&quot;, as I sometimes hear myself say. Ok, so here goes...

Scott, when I first saw your YouTube clips online a few years back, they immediately stood out as having something extra. Well, lots of things, actually. This was both an instant recognition and a steadily growing conviction, as the clips kept coming.

I never thought I&#039;d be committed to one &quot;guru&quot; or mentor, or that such a guru would even exist. Most of all, I never thought I&#039;d see living proof of the beautiful notion that there actually can be such a thing as a free lunch - or at least a lunch consistently priced just high enough to balance its production cost.

And, consequently, that there are people out there who are so genuinely committed to offering high-quality service just for the sake of it - and who don&#039;t at some point veer from that lofty ambition.

Your recent &quot;new-year&#039;s resolution&quot; reinforced this assessment and placed it above any doubt that you are, as they say, &quot;the real deal&quot;. Constantly striving for even *more* content, higher quality, greater reach, more effective learning etc.

Not only are you sincere and pure of intent, and seemingly incorruptible when it comes to keeping away from the ever allusive &quot;good enough&quot; mentality that must surely haunt every (online) entrepreneur - you are also uniquely gifted.

After watching you and listening to you play for almost every day during the last two years (or more) by now - I can still honestly say that I&#039;d rather look at (and hear) you playing a C major scale than most other bass-related stuff online, combined. Your sound, your technique and your commitment is such that there simply cannot exist a better role model for aspiring musicians. It just looks and sounds so good.

And this is despite the fact that you have battled - and still are - a debilitating affliction!

And that&#039;s just a C-major scale... Then, of course, there are all those - inspiring and pedagogical! - improvisations, examples, riffs.... And *then*, there are the studio work, the original compositions, and the solo arrangements. All of which is good enough to stand entirely on its own - and is among the best music an playing I have ever heard, in any category.

So far I have praised your unique commitment and &quot;purity of heart&quot; when it comes to being dedicated to deliver and constantly improve bass learning (not just teaching, in itself) on a global scale. Not only are you an idealist, you are also extraordinarily pragmatic and focused on what actually works - for the students. You seem to genuinely measure your own success, not in the number of subscribers, but in the number of great-sounding bassist and bass lines the world is actually bequeathed.

But there is more. Your work ethic is absolutely phenomenal. Not only when it comes to the work your currently doing on SBL but also your current personal musical ambitions. And, above all, the staggering amount of work that you have done in the past - which is obvious to see for anyone. Not only does it produce a level of playing and instructional skills that are hard to match, but it acts as the ultimate inspiration and role model for anyone aspiring to become good at anything.

And you&#039;re *drive*! On top of everything else, you must be one of the most single-minded &quot;doers&quot; out there. Fortunately for us! (Not to diminish the work of all the rest of your staff and other collaborators, of course. Quite the opposite, actually.)

I am getting relatively old (I&#039;m 45 now) and I thought the time for me to learn - really learn - new tricks was past. But by following your instructions and performance I have been humbled both in the sense of a new respect for the amount of work and commitment it actually takes to &quot;walk the walk, not just talk the talk&quot;, but also in the sense that I am reaching new levels of patience with myself. Something that I can even pass on to my children: &quot;Wax on, wax off&quot;, as Todd Johnsson would say. Yeah, keep your head to the ground and keep working, freeing yourself from all forms of arrogance, hubris, self-deception, instant gratification and what not. (There&#039;s a whole life philosophy in that &quot;Practicing Mind&quot; mind-set.)

Scott, you need to know - I need you to know - this. SBL and the Academy is a beautiful thing. You are a beautiful person. If you quit tomorrow, I would still stand by my claim that you have done the world an exceptional amount of good, at virtually no cost at all.

We can only hope - and there&#039;s no indication we&#039;ll be disappointed - that you keep on being who you are and keep on delivering, and continually keep surpassing previous expectations.

You da man, Scott!]]></description>

Then getting full access to the full SBL Academy site is just icing on the cake!!
