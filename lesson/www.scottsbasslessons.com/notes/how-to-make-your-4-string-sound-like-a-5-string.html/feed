		<description><![CDATA[I have been considering writing an ebook on the subject of bass tone with advice including the exact EQ settings and hand positions to try out for various styles and gigs aand I stumbled on this great post.  I have a 5 string, but I just don&#039;t love the way it plays compared to my &#039;76 Fender Music Master (with Bill Lawrence pickups).

I&#039;ve noticed one of the great things about your advice is that you give specifics, like the exact settings for the Octabass pedal.  I also noticed you gave specific settings in your SBL material on EQ&#039;ing your bass too, and this is the kind of insight I would have been scouring the internet for when I first started.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[By the way. Scott, you are the best bass teacher I never had. Your approach makes total sense and you give great explanation on how to get the style and sounds down. It&#039;s almost like you unleashed the magic tricks that have been kept secret. Thank you and bless you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would guess that it is a bigger challenge to produce good sound on the B string using a 5 string bass while maintaining it in scale than to reproduce the sound with an octaver. Just the physics of having something vibrate relatively little and put it on an instrument. I play in a worship team where we play in odd keys to accommodate vocal ranges and the bass patterns only sound good going up. Those notes I end up playing for that music style takes away so an octaver makes sense. I could not get used to the 5 string and you do have to pay more for ones that would play a tight B.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, I recently discovered your lessons, and must commend you on the excellent job. 

On your pentatonic lessons I really enjoyed some of the runs you did as it would really suit my style of playing. 
Are there tabs available for these and where would I be able to find them?

Thanks for the awesome material!

Regards]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hiya,

I remember that &#039;playing high when wanting to go low&#039; seemed a bit counter-intuitive at first. Theory for the multiples was already quite nicely wrapped in Jimster&#039;s comment so I won&#039;t repeat it here. 

This is the reason why you really want an octave box to have a strong and clean signal. In some songs I have successfully used 2 octaves down from G (or even A) without the original signal present - with passive bass. Down there it&#039;s really necessary to dig in to strings. In these situations it&#039;s also really handy to have a volume pedal for applying the dynamics (after octaver, of course). 

Based on Jimster&#039;s comment, it&#039;s also good to notice that these octave-boxes come in two flavours, mono- and polyphonic (mentioned EHX pog is polyphonic). Strumming chords is not cool with the monophonic, but it results same kind of &#039;garbage garble&#039; as hitting a note tad too low. On the other hand and based solely on my experiences, monophonic boxes seem to track the current note a little better though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome cover, really great, loved it.
With all respect, I humbly agree with Ken about the mixing and her vocals, I mean she is quite something and could&#039;ve been exposed a bit more... but hey killer cover!!!
It makes me proud to call you my bass teacher, my man, you pinpoint a wide range of aspects related to playing the bass.
Great job!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just listen to these bass lines for the first time with good speakers.Nothing short of incredible Scott.You stated that playing anything lower than B on  the E string sounds kind of weird.Why I ask as is  I play a 4 string US  musicman stirling bass .I have hand problems myself and this is a breeze to play but the sound of the D G strings sounds to piano like for me most of the time.Would you think that the ebs Octabass pedal would have any good effects on the D&#038;G .It sounds like the 5 string problem might be solved until I have a purchased a 5 string that is playable with these old fingers.Love your stuff]]></description>
