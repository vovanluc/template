				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm on holiday with the family right now (and LOVING it!), but, I really didn't want to skip a week and not send you anything... so, I thought I'd treat you to something I usually keep only for members of the membership here at SBL.</p>
<p>And, if you're already a member at SBL I'm sure it's been a while since you watched this, so you're going to love it too...</p>
<p>Just over a year ago, Victor Wooten swung by SBL Towers... and obviously we grabbed a camera and filmed an entire interview with him whilst he was here!</p>
<p>As you'd expect, he dropped some serious knowledge bombs such as;</p>
<ul>
<li>How he picked up the bass aged two and was playing live at the ripe old age of six!</li>
<li>How he was tutored by his four brothers, particularly his guitar-playing brother Regi.</li>
<li>How he learned to tap by listening to Stanley Jordan.</li>
<li>About his collaboration with Stanley Clarke and Marcus Miller under the moniker of SMV</li>
<li>And much, much more…</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)<br />

<p>Nick Wells meets Ben Walker, bandleader, sideman and trainee gym instructor.</p>
<p>In this regular feature we shine a light on a select few SBL students regarded by many as ‘ones to watch.’ Throughout the year, we’ll be catching up with a diverse set of breaking and established talent to air their thoughts and experiences about bass playing, tunes and music in general from their own vantage point (the only thing that anyone can do, really). Want to join them? If you're studying with SBL and would like to share your experiences, then please don't hesitate to <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>CONTACT US</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>Ben Walker - 6-String King!</h2>
<p>Ben Walker is the latest breath of fresh air to drift through the SBL campus. Blending a love of Latin and Afro-Cuban music into his bass playing, his command of a 6-string Warwick Streamer continues to gain acclaim among the world of instrumental guitar music. He learnt the ropes while still at school, and thanks to a succession of school gigs, Ben soon grasped the fundamentals of bass playing, while his natural instincts were turning into calculated theory as his practice persevered. “I was staying back after hours at school,” he remembers. “I was walking past some of the practice rooms and I heard a bass player jamming with a drummer. I had never heard anything as cool or as funky before, so I went in the next day and told the head of music that I wanted to learn to play bass. My first bass was a Cort GB24, MM-style bass and my first gig was around a month after I first started playing.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px;"><span style="color: #ee8c3f; font-size: 25px;"><em><strong>“I was walking past some of the practice rooms and I heard a bass player jamming with a drummer. I had never heard anything as cool or as funky before..."</strong></em></span></p>
<p>As far as Ben’s bass goes, these days he rarely uses anything other than his Warwick Streamer. “My main bass is a 6-string 1997 Warwick Streamer. It’s been modified over the years and I’ve added an East UK U-Retro preamp, a finger ramp, some small banjo frets and a set of Gotoh Ultralite tuners. I’m fascinated by the chordal and harmonic potential of the 6-string bass and it’s a wonderful instrument. I feel completely at home with it every time I play.”</p>
<p>Ben has quite a few plans for the next few months, including the mouth-watering prospect of teaming up with session singer Louise Turner to record, and his own album as a bandleader. “Right now, I’m writing the music for my first record as a bandleader. It’s taking a lot longer than I had anticipated coming up with the music, but I’m slowly getting somewhere! I’ve also just gotten involved with a wonderful singer/songwriter called Louise Turner. We’re in the middle of pre-production for her first record and have our first studio session next month. It should be released sometime towards the end of the year.</p>
<h3>What do you remember about your first gig?</h3>
<p>It was a rock covers gig and I only knew about six notes on the fingerboard! We didn't really know what we were doing, but we loved music and just wanted to play!</p>
<h3>How would you describe your playing style?</h3>
<p>My playing style has changed a lot since I really started digging into improvised music a couple of years ago. I’m a lot more focused on melodic playing than I used to be.</p>
<h3>How did you find ScottsBassLessons?</h3>
<p>I first met Scott through university. I took a couple of private lessons with him and started checking out his online videos. His instructional stuff has been a fantastic resource for me over the last 5 years, so when he re-opened enrolment I <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/sbl-academy-checkout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signed up for the Academy!</a></p>
<h3>What have you gained from being a member of SBL?</h3>
<p>Motivation has been the main thing. Seeing so many players motivated to explore and improve gives me a lot of motivation to practice and continue developing as a player. Some of the courses coming out now have been fantastic. I’ve been working on <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/courses/contemporary-groove-techniques-with-damian-erskine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Damian Erskine’s 3-finger technique</a> for a while and his course has been incredible to take in.</p>
<h3>Who are your favourite players?</h3>
<p>There are a lot of bassists whose playing I really like but the ones that influence me most at present are <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/damian-erskine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Damian Erskine</a>, Matthew Garrison, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/rich-brown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rich Brown</a> and John Patitucci. They all have a really unique voice and approach to the instrument, which is something I'm actively striving for. Other musicians that influence me include Pat Metheny, Tord Gustavsen, Hiromi, Mike Stern, Guthrie Govan, Marco Minneman, Steve Smith and Jojo Mayer.</p>
<h3>Tell us about your backline…</h3>
<p>I use a Trace Elliot AH300 head and a pair of Vanderkley 1x12 cabinets. I have a small collection of pedals too, but the two mainstays are the TC Ditto and the TC Nova Repeater.</p>
<h3>What's your best gigging tip?</h3>
<p>Do your homework and make musical choices! It’s always better to sweat while you’re in the shed so you can relax and really enjoy the performance, rather than sweating on stage. If you’re working as a sideman, try and make your MD’s life as simple as possible by showing up on time, learning the music and being easy to be around.</p>
<h3>How do you unwind?</h3>
<p>I usually unwind by listening to music and hitting the gym. I’m also training to become a gym instructor and a strength/conditioning coach.</p>
<h3>What would you be if you weren’t a bass player?</h3>
<p>I’d probably be a personal trainer.</p>

<p>Nick Wells and Medicine X bassist Daniel Wester sit down to discuss all things bass.</p>
<p>In this regular feature we shine a light on a select few SBL students regarded by many as ‘ones to watch.’ Throughout the year, we’ll be catching up with a diverse set of breaking and established talent to air their thoughts and experiences about bass playing, tunes and music in general from their own vantage point (the only thing that anyone can do, really). Want to join them?

<h2>Daniel Wester - Medicine X</h2>
<p>Reality has a wonderful way of bringing us all down to earth, and bassist Daniel Wester is realising that it’s just good to be able to do what he loves: “I recently started a new band called Medicine X,” he tells us. “It’s a blues/rock/funk trio and we're playing in clubs and bars this summer.”</p>
<p>Every player has areas for improvement, though, he agrees. Asked how he’s evolved as a bass player in the years that he’s been playing bass, Daniel explains: “I have always aimed to be as versatile as I can and I hope that you can hear that in the way I play. In fact, Scott has the same kind of attitude as I do in trying to teach people to be as adaptable as possible and in different genres.”</p>
<p>Is he also a more intuitive player these days, we ask? Definitely: “When I joined SBL I was a bit stuck in terms of my progress, but the support I got from the SBL community has given me a huge boost. I already knew how to read music and I understood theory, but thanks to SBL and the monthly challenges I’ve really expanded my portfolio of songs, which is essential.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #ee8c3f; font-size: 30px;"><em><strong>“When I joined SBL I was a bit stuck in terms of my progress, but the support I got from the SBL community has given me a huge boost"</strong></em></span></p>
<p>Daniel deploys a range of basses with Medicine X. “My main bass is a Sandberg P4, which is now called the VM4). I also have a Cort B4 Fretless, a Pitbull Guitars DIY 6-string fretless that I built earlier this year, a Yamaha BBG5, a Squier Affinity Jazz Bass, a Cort Action Bass and a Harley Benton EUB.”</p>
<p>We will let Daniel take it from here.</p>
<h3>How did you get started playing bass?</h3>
<p>It was by accident to be honest. I started out as a drummer at the age of 8, but I later decided to apply to a music school with classical guitar as my main instrument. I got accepted, but once we started the first semester I found out that there were no bass players in our class. I wasn’t the best guitarist, so I volunteered to play bass. That was in 1994 and I’ve been playing ever since.</p>
<h3>What do you remember about your first bass?</h3>
<p>My first bass was a Yamaha BBN5. I was already into jazz, fusion and soul music, so I thought a 5-string would make me more versatile.</p>
<h3>How did you find ScottsBassLessons?</h3>
<p>I found SBL via YouTube and I liked the way Scott was teaching.</p>
<h3>Who are your favourite players?</h3>
<p>I’ve always loved Jimmy Haslip's bass playing. Unfortunately, I haven't met with him or heard him live yet, but it's on my bucket list. It's, of course, impossible not to mention Jaco, Jamerson or Rocco Prestia. I also love Tal Wilkenfeld, Janek Gwizdala, Tony Grey, Michael Manring, Lee Sklar, Jeff Andrews, Federico Malaman, Hadrien Feraud... well, the list can go on forever. Naturally, Scott Devine is on that list too, otherwise I would never have found my way to SBL!</p>
<h3>How do you practice?</h3>
<p>This is where I feel a bit ashamed because I don't! I do study songs for upcoming gigs and transcribe bass lines and licks now and then, but a practice routine? No. Sorry. I work full-time and I take care of my two kids, so the little time I have left I spend just noodling around to keep my technique in shape. I wish I could be one of those guys with a dedicated practice routine, but I never have been and probably never will.</p>
<h3>Tell us about your backline…</h3>
<p>I play through a Trace Elliot Series 6 head and a 2x12 Soundcab cabinet. I’ve also got a Markbass Little Mark Blackline 250 with a TKS 1126 cab. For smaller gigs I use a GK MB150S combo.</p>
<h3>What's your best gigging tip?</h3>
<p>Be well prepared. If you’re not, then make sure you act like you are! Be on time, be confident, but be humble. If you can do that then the people you meet will be more likely to call you again when they next need a bass player. Make sure you carry extra gear (cables, batteries, strings, etc.) just in case.</p>
<h3>How do you unwind?</h3>
<p>By playing bass! Other than that, I spend time with my kids. We’ll watch a film or just dumbly surf the web and social media. Book reading is also a great way to gain energy and knowledge. I listen to a lot of music all the time and I am pretty good at doing nothing.</p>
<h3>What would you be if you weren’t a bass player?</h3>
<p>I probably would have been a drummer. I’m not a full time bass player today. I have a day job as a product manager for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), which I also love doing, but I can't imagine a life without playing music. I tried it for a few years when my kids were born, but there was just a part of me missing.</p>

<p>Nick Wells meets Tim Hill, bassist with latin quintet Agave.</p>
<p>In this regular feature we shine a light on a select few SBL students regarded by many as ‘ones to watch.’ Throughout the year, we’ll be catching up with a diverse set of breaking and established talent to air their thoughts and experiences about bass playing, tunes and music in general from their own vantage point (the only thing that anyone can do, really). Want to join them? If you're studying with SBL and would like to share your experiences, then please don't hesitate to <strong><a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/contact">Contact Us</a></strong></p>
<h2>Tim Hill - Low Note Music</h2>
<p>As a bass player who plays in a latin quintet, and is in the process of forming an acoustic blues outfit, Tim Hill has a professional outlook from which we could all learn. “If I’ve got a gig then I try to arrive one or two hours in advance of the first downbeat, just so I can get setup calmly and still have plenty of time to chill and focus before the gig. So even if I arrive on time I actually feel as though I’m late!”</p>
<p>In the past, Tim was most commonly seen onstage sporting a Gibson Grabber, but a recent hook up with Warrior Instruments has led to a new arrival. “I have an Isabella fretted 5-string that’s in the final stages of build,” says Tim. “I also have a DM 5-string fretless that’s also from Warrior Instruments, a Kiesel Icon IC6 and a 1976 Gibson Grabber.” For amps and pedals, Tim likes to stick with what sounds and feels best for him. “I play through a Phil Jones BG400 combo and use a pretty simple pedalboard that’s kitted out with an MXR Envelope Filter, an EHX Soul Food overdrive, a Tech 21 Preamp/DI and a TC Electronic SpectraComp, Corona, Chorus and Hall of Fame reverb.”</p>
<p>So what’s Tim’ philosophy when it comes to practicing? He replies: “My practice routine doesn’t have a set time frame. I’ll go on until I’ve achieved what I set out to do that day. It can last anywhere from 45 minutes to 3 hours depending on what I’m working on. I always start out with a stretch and a warm up period that usually involves some kind of finger independence work and some material from one or two SBL courses. Finally, I’ll focus on the music that I’m working on for an upcoming rehearsal, video shoot or recording session.”</p>
<h3>How did you get started playing bass?</h3>
<p>When I was in 9th grade we were offered a band class for the very first time. I wanted to play guitar, but I didn’t have the knowledge to handle that, so my band director suggested I take up bass, which I did. That was in 1979 and the rest is history.</p>
<h3>What do you remember about your first bass?</h3>
<p>My first bass was a Montgomery Ward, short-scale P-Bass knock off. It didn’t last but a couple of months. After that, my parents bought me a 1978 Gibson Grabber and that’s the bass that took me through High School. I sold it just before college to get another P-Bass clone and instantly regretted it. It took me 30 years to acquire another Grabber, but this time one from 1976.</p>
<h3>How about your first gig?</h3>
<p>My first real gig didn’t take place until my first year of university, but it wasn’t on bass. It was on tuba for a dixieland band. The top bassist/tubist at the university was taken ill literally hours before the annual jazz festival and I was called in to play in three different ensembles. It was the single most impactful moment in my musical life.</p>
<h3>How would you describe your playing style now?</h3>
<p>My playing style has evolved a bit over the last four or five years. I started out learning jazz and then moved on to pop and rock. In 2013 I started really honing in on latin music as well as my own material, so my style now is a combination of roots, rock, finger-stlye funk, latin and modern jazz.</p>
<h3>How did you find ScottsBassLessons?</h3>
<p>I first discovered SBL in 2014 through Scott’s YouTube videos. After watching several of those I joined the academy in 2015.</p>
<h3>What have you gained from being a member of SBL?</h3>
<p>Wow! There’s so much I could say about what I’ve gained. The main takeaway for me was successfully correcting some long-standing bad habits and re-discovering a structure to my practice time through the logs.</p>
<h3>Tell us about your projects outside of SBL</h3>
<p>My primary project is my latin quintet called Agave. We play Afro-Brazillian, Afro-Cuban and Latin Jazz classics. Beyond that, I’m in the process of forming an acoustic blues project and a bass guitar duet that has programmed accompaniment. Down the road I have plans to remix my first CD and do some more songwriting.</p>
<h3>Who are your favourite players?</h3>
<p>At the moment I’m really into Jaco, Jimmy Haslip, Stefan lessard, Nathan East, Mark King, Oskar Cartaya and Abe Laboriel.</p>
<h3>How do you unwind?</h3>
<p>These days my favourite thing to do to unwind is to play with my young son. Whenever possible, we head out to Malibu with my wife to hang out and hunt sea shells in tidal pools. I also like to just unplug from everything, turn off the lights and bask in the quiet!</p>
<h3>What would you be if you weren’t a bass player?</h3>

<p>Stolen Rhodes bassist Jack Zaferes tells Nick Wells about the highs and lows of playing in a Philadelphia rock band.</p>
<p>In this regular feature we shine a light on a select few SBL students regarded by many as ‘ones to watch.’ Throughout the year, we’ll be catching up with a diverse set of breaking and established talent to air their thoughts and experiences about bass playing, tunes and music in general from their own vantage point (the only thing that anyone can do, really). Want to join them? If you're studying with SBL and would like to share your experiences, then please don't hesitate to <strong><a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/contact">Contact Us</a></strong></p>
<h2>Jack Zaferes - Stolen Rhodes</h2>
<p>You’ve got to like Jack Zaferes. For starters, he has that US charisma that we Brits are such suckers for, telling us how much he has gained from studying with SBL (“I can see parts of Scott's teachings in every aspect of my playing!”) – but also because he doesn’t have a shred of arrogance about his career as a bass player. So how did he enter the murky world of bass in the first place, we ask? “Everyone in my family played an instrument,” says Jack. “As soon as I was old enough to jam I was thrown into the bass chair! I think I was in 8th grade when I played my first gig. I was playing in a reggae band and I remember showing up with a huge cabinet and being way too loud! It was a good time.”</p>
<p>Based on mighty riffs from frontman Matt Pillion and guitarist Kevin Cunningham, Jacks’ band Stolen Rhodes remain among the hardest-hitting rock bands around, especially on their new record, Bend With The Wind. Recorded at Dylanava Studios, just outside of Philadelphia, with the assistance of producer David Ivory (Halestorm, The Roots, Silvertide) and mastered by Ted Jensen (The Eagles, John Mayer, AC/DC), the album includes songs that have been extensively road-tested, along with a few that were written right in the studio. “We’ve been on the road constantly for the past year and we’re opening for Blackberry Smoke, Marshall Tucker Band, The Outlaws and Montgomery Gentry for the rest of the tour!”</p>
<p>In addition to his gig with Stolen Rhodes, Jack has also been cutting his teeth with some successful studio tracks with a variety of artists – including Curtis Cooper and Abi Remould. Asked what the secret of good bass playing is, Jack muses: “I try to incorporate a menagerie of styles that are appropriate for whatever tunes I'm playing. Whether it's playing a finger-style walking line over a jazz standard or a wild slap-tap-funk thing, it’s just a matter of using the right paint and the right brushstrokes for what’s needed to make the overall image shine.”</p>
<p>Stolen Rhodes’s album, Bend With The Wind, is out now - <strong><a href="http://www.stolenrhodes.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.stolenrhodes.com</a></strong></p>
<h3>What's the music scene like in Philadelphia?</h3>
<p>It’s a vast morphing beautiful ever changing force! Philadelphia has it all from rock to jazz, world, classical, grindcore even funk! My favorite part about living here is the ability to jam with so many different artists of all different genres from around the world!</p>
<h3>What do you remember about your first bass?</h3>
<p>My first bass was an old ‘80s Jackson with the pointy metal band headstock and all. It's still in my collection today. I'll never get rid of that hunk-a-junk!</p>
<h3>What have you gained from being a member of SBL?</h3>
<p>I’ve gained tons from Scott's teachings. I started using his study pieces to build my vocabulary, but I’ve also learned how to truly feel a groove and breathe with a tune. The guy’s got a great way of explaining things to his students that for me is easy to follow.</p>
<h3>Who are your favourite players?</h3>
<p>JACO!</p>
<h3>How do you practice?</h3>
<p>My practice methods vary on a weekly basis. I try to have fun while I practice, so I'll take tunes that I really like and pick them apart. I’ll start by learning the chord changes, then the melody and then I’ll solo over it. I always try to keep things musical. In the beginning I was always practicing scales and modes, but that turned into such a drag! So I'll just pick stuff that's fun now. It could be something by Jamiroquai, Megadeth or even Bach’s Cello Suites. Recently I've been working on the head to Mike Sterns "Mood Swings".</p>
<h3>Tell us about your gear…</h3>
<p>I am a through-and-through Fender Jazz player! I have a 2016 American Jazz Bass and a 2010 Jazz Deluxe. I also play Aguilar amps. Nothing beats that combo of Aguilar and a Jazz Bass! I play Ernie Ball Super Slinkys too.</p>
<h3>What's your best gigging tip?</h3>
<p>Be prepared for everything! Don't just learn the bass part to a tune. Learn the melody, transpose it, solo over it and be ready for any possible outcome!</p>
<h3>What would you be if you weren’t a bass player?</h3>
<p>Probably a Ninja or a Chemist or a mixture of both!</p>

<p>Introducing Toby Ellis from Watford-based alt-rock band Corolla.</p>
<p>In this regular feature we shine a light on a select few SBL students regarded by many as ‘ones to watch.’ Throughout the year, we’ll be catching up with a diverse set of breaking and established talent to air their thoughts and experiences about bass playing, tunes and music in general from their own vantage point (the only thing that anyone can do, really). Want to join them? If you're studying with SBL and would like to share your experiences, then please don't hesitate to <strong><a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/contact">Contact Us</a></strong></p>
<h2>Toby Ellis - Corolla</h2>
<p>2017 has seen a number of young bands break out from seemingly nowhere as key ‘ones to watch’ in the UK, and Watford-based alt-rock band Corolla certainly live up to their billing. Remarkably, bassist Toby Ellis is relaxed about it all, focusing on his bass playing and his teaching. “I’m a private music teacher, which is my full-time job,” he tells us. “I have a Grade 8 and a University Degree in Music, which is built around my drumming, so I would actually say the bass is my third best instrument!”</p>
<p>For someone who picked up the bass out of necessity, Toby’s done pretty well. “I bought my first bass at university to help record some songs,” he says. “I was playing lead guitar at the time, but my band had a gig that our bass player couldn't prepare for so I volunteered to play bass for the gig. I learnt the songs, did the gig (blisters and all) and got huge praise from everyone there. As it looked like I would become a permanent fixture on bass, so I decided to get a subscription to SBL so I could figure out how to play more like a bass player and not a guitar player, and further develop my right-hand blisters!”</p>
<p>All this practice has led Toby into new areas of bass playing, he explains: “I’ve been transcribing Micheal League a lot lately, having just been to see him with Snarky Puppy at the Cheltenham Jazz Festival. I also saw Meshell Ndegeocello there and she was fantastic, she gets so much power from such tiny hand movements. Her economy of motion is really inspiring.”</p>
<p>Nowadays Toby delivers the juice on a Fender Jazz Bass. “It’s got a nice big chip in it from a pub gig,” he tells us. “I also use a Digitech RP500 Multi-Effects unit, which has an octave function that tracks the bass surprisingly well. I also use a TC Electronic MojoMojo overdrive as a slight boost/saturation pedal on heavier songs. If I can, I’ll try to use neither, and just turn up with my bass and get on with the gig! The most important piece of gear is my ear protection - I’d still like a career when I’m older!”</p>

<h3>Tell us about your projects outside of SBL</h3>
<p>I play bass in Watford-based alt rock band Corolla. We recently had a gig supporting Paul Weller! I also have a solo project and released a single two years ago that was played on BBC Radio 6 Music. My full-time job is as a self-employed private music teacher. I drive from house-to-house in the Cheltenham/Gloucester area teaching people drums, guitar, bass, piano, singing, songwriting, recording etc. Running my own business is fantastic and it means I get to run off gigging whenever I need to.</p>
<h3>How would you describe your playing style?</h3>
<p>I started out playing with a stubby pick and now I use fingers almost exclusively, unless I want that pick sound for a particular recording. I also use musicians gloves just like Scott, but unlike Scott, I use them because I get sweaty hands that make playing without them very difficult. They also help prevent blisters when I’ve been practicing for 12 hours at a time!</p>
<h3>What have you gained from being a member of SBL?</h3>
<p>Community focus. Being around (virtually) lots of people who are all trying to get better is hugely inspiring. Taking part in the 67-day habit building challenges has been fantastic. Getting lots of feedback from Scott in the student reviews is huge - every member should be submitting a video to him every time a review comes round as it’s so inspiring and useful! I listen to all the Bass Hangs and the Academy shows on long drives from Gloucester (where I live) to Watford (where I gig) and have by osmosis gained tons of general musicianship and bass player knowledge.</p>
<h3>Who are your favourite players?</h3>
<p>Damon Minchella from Ocean Colour Scene. His playing on OCS records is perfection. He always chooses the most tasteful thing to play, and of course, he played on all those mid-90s Paul Weller records. The same goes for David LaBruyere, who was John Mayer's bass player from the beginning of his career all the way through to Where The Light Is, when he hired Sean Hurley. Sean is really great too and <strong><a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/podcast/in-conversation-with-sean-hurley-jazz-was-the-gateway">Scott did a fantastic interview with him</a>.</strong> Guy Berryman from Coldplay is also someone who has caught my attention. Re-listening to those first three Coldplay records, he makes some really clever line choices and I can imagine he is a very under-rated artist on bass.</p>
<h3>How do you practice?</h3>
<p>My practice comes in short bursts around doing Corolla gigs, but I would practice very differently if the bass was my sole focus or my professional gig. I would read functional (jazz) music in all 12 keys and dominate the fretboard. For now, that is not my priority, but one day I would like to dedicate myself to a quantum leap in fretboard knowledge. Scott's <strong><a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/harmonic-layering-arpeggios-chord-tones-scales">harmonic layering course</a></strong> is where it is at folks, use it!</p>
<h3>What's your best gigging tip?</h3>
<p>Double check everything, turn up early, wear your ear protection and be a pro. I record all the gigs for the band with a Zoom H4N recorder, which accelerates the improvement of the band like nothing else.</p>
<h3>Any career highlights?</h3>
<p>Supporting Paul Weller! He is one of my idols. We also supported Nils Lofgren. Also, the first time I got one of my songs stuck in my head as a teenager was a real shift in thinking.</p>
<h3>How do you unwind?</h3>
<p>I like golf, skiing and running. I also take 15-minute breaks from work to do keepie-ups in the garden with a football. I try to weaponise boredom. I will stare at a clock for 10 minutes if I need to unwind and within 3 minutes I'm so bored I go straight back to actions that move me closer to my goals.</p>
<h3>What would you be if you weren't a bass player?</h3>
<p>In a way, I'm not! If the question was “what would you be if you weren't a musician?”... Probably a really cheesy life coach and a motivational speaker. Tony Robbins would have nothing on me!</p>
<h3>What's been the best thing about 2017 so far?</h3>
<p>That Paul Weller support slot! Also seeing Pino Palladino with John Mayer at the 02 Arena for my birthday. Along with Michael League at the aforementioned Snarky Puppy gig. I am constantly surrounding myself with good bass playing!</p>
<h3>And the worst?</h3>
<p>I stepped in some cat poo while doing keepie-ups in the garden today in a break from bass playing. Life is pretty good when I can say that that is the worst thing that has happened to me this year!</p>

<p>For this week’s Student Spotlight, Olle Risberg tells all about his Swedish rock band, Three Seasons.</p>
<p>In this regular feature we shine a light on a select few SBL students regarded by many as ‘ones to watch.’ Throughout the year, we’ll be catching up with a diverse set of breaking and established talent to air their thoughts and experiences about bass playing, tunes and music in general from their own vantage point (the only thing that anyone can do, really). Want to join them? If you're studying with SBL and would like to share your experiences, then please don't hesitate to <strong><a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/contact">Contact Us</a></strong></p>
<h2>Olle Risberg - Three Seasons</h2>
<p>“When we started I was only 16 years old and I have learnt so, so much from everything we’ve done. I absolutely believe that my band members, Sartez Faraj (guitars and vocals) and Thomas Broman (drums), are among the greatest Swedish rock musicians of all time. Some of the things they come up with are simply amazing.” Bassist Olle Risberg is talking about his band, Three Seasons, who in the grand tradition of Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin, like to play the shock-rock game, and it’s a game that has taken them to European acclaim amid the hard-rock community. “We started back in 2009 and since then we’ve released three full length albums and one 7-inch vinyl single,” says Olle. “We’ve also toured and played several festivals in Sweden and in Germany, Spain, France and Switzerland.”</p>
<p>Asked how he’s evolved as a bass player in the years that he’s been playing, Olle explains: “The band is definitely the one thing that’s helped my development as a musician. I’m very proud to have played on all the records that we’ve produced and they’ve all received a lot of praise in the media. One magazine even said that our first album was among the best 70’s-style albums of the century. But media praise wouldn’t matter much if I weren’t this happy with the albums myself. Of course, you can always find things in your playing that you think you might have been able to do better, but overall these records are absolute highlights for me. They’ll stay with me until I die.”</p>
<p>Olle deploys a range of basses with his band, including a Sadowsky J, but also using Fender Precision basses as requirements dictate. “My main bass is a Fender Precision from 1969,” he tells us. “I love that bass and will most likely keep it for the rest of my life. My second bass is a Sadowsky J, which is also very good, but in a different way. The Sadowsky has all the advantages of a well-made modern bass; an active preamp, a thinner neck, a very low string height, but it definitely lacks the soul of the ‘69 Fender. I also have a newer Fender P, which I use with flat wound strings. My rig consists of an Ampeg V-4B head and a Löfving 2x15 cab. I don’t use a lot of pedals, but I like my SansAmp preamp and my Diamond compressor a lot. Check out this pic, which I took a few months ago in preparation for a recording session:</p>

<h3>How did you get started playing bass?</h3>
<p>Growing up we had a lot of musical instruments at home. Before I picked up the bass I played drums and then guitar. I never got hooked on the drums, but the guitar was a blast. I was really into that for a while and then for some reason I just wanted to try the bass and then I was hooked immediately.</p>
<h3>What do you remember about your first bass?</h3>
<p>It was a cheap, short-scale bass that was black and not very good. I didn’t take proper care of it either. Some of the major problems had to do with the strings, but I hadn’t figured out that you were supposed to cut the strings to the proper length before putting them on, so my bass always had a massive amount of superfluous string around the tuning post. I usually couldn’t afford to buy new strings either, so I always had really old strings. Whenever they broke I tried to make them usable again with all these weird knots! Needless to say, that didn’t work well.</p>
<h3>How about your first gig?</h3>
<p>My first gig was a school thing. We had a little band that played “Don’t Stop Me Now” by Queen at a school show. It wasn’t an amazing performance by any means, but we did reasonably well.</p>
<h3>How would you describe your playing style now?</h3>
<p>Right now, I’m into the rhythmic, Motown-vibe style of players like James Jamerson, John Paul Jones, Joe Dart and Pino Palladino. I often end up mixing that approach with more classic rock stuff.</p>
<h3>Tell us about your band</h3>
<p>My band is called “Three Seasons”. It’s a 60/70’s-style psychedelic blues/rock band, in the style of Deep Purple, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and so on.</p>
<h3>Who are your favourite players?</h3>
<p>James Jamerson, John Paul Jones, Pino Palladino, Roger Glover, Glenn Hughes, Joe Dart, Michael League, Rob Mullarkey… the list goes on. Other musicians who have inspired me greatly include John Bonham and Jimmy Page from Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Jon Lord, Cory Henry, First Aid Kit, Joni Mitchell, Mike Miley and Jay Buchanan from the Rival Sons, D'Angelo, Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin and Lianne La Havas.</p>
<h3>How do you practice?</h3>
<p>When I have the time, I do my best to structure things very clearly in terms of my schedule, my main aims and different exercises I want to focus on. I always try to keep in mind that it’s better to play every day, even if only for a little bit, than to have very long practice sessions once or twice a week. Recently though, I have focused a lot on the new album and thus haven’t been able to practice regularly in any structured way. Instead, these days, I spend a lot of time simply jamming and transcribing songs I like.</p>
<h3>What's your best gigging tip?</h3>
<p>You’re on stage for a reason: to show people your music. Thus, you should not pretend to be someone else. You should just be yourself. Don’t be afraid to show people who you are, including those traits that you aren’t perfectly happy with. Just let it all out.</p>
<h3>How do you unwind?</h3>
<p>By playing the bass! It’s hard for me not to think about work - I am doing a Ph.D. in philosophy, and that stuff is in my head almost all the time, but playing the bass is one of my few means for letting go of that for a little bit.</p>
<h3>What would you be if you weren’t a bass player?</h3>
<p>Not sure. I love almost all instruments when they’re used well, even though my abilities are very limited with regard to most of them. I would like to be able to play a brass instrument, some keyboards and some percussion, but I am not sure which I would have focused on if I hadn’t chosen the bass.</p>

<p>For our latest Student Spotlight we’ve tracked down one of the groovers and shakers behind Moscow’s indie pop scene.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, we’ll be touching base with a diverse set of breaking and established talent to air their thoughts and experiences about bass playing, tunes and music in general from their own vantage point (the only thing that anyone can do, really). Want to join them? If you're studying with SBL and would like to share your experiences, then please don't hesitate to <strong><a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/contact">Contact Us</a></strong> as we'd love to share your story and promote your music to the SBL audience!</p>
<h2>Dima Midborn - Bass On-The-Go</h2>
<p>Good things come to those who wait. Just ask Dima Midborn, the self-confessed bass junkie from Moscow. His all-encompassing approach has produced a sophisticated playing style that’s a far cry from the fledgling riffs he cut when he first started out. Dima was the archetypal guitarist cast in a new role. “I used to play the guitar, but I found myself writing songs for a band that didn't need a guitarist,” he tells us. “But it sure needed a bass player! So I switched to bass because I liked the music and that band was something new to me. So the choice of instrument was purely accidental.”</p>
<p>So how does Dima set about working on new material? “I'm a late starter,” he explains. “I first picked up the bass when I was 23 or 24 years old, so I still was too young to understand that practicing is everything. I mean, not just fiddling around with a bass, but also really digging in. I think I gave up a lot of time for nothing, but now I play every day for two hours at the very least. No matter what, there' always time to practice with or without my bass. First thing's first, I warm up for 15-30 minutes and then I’ll transcribe a new tune or a riff. Once I’ve got my ears tuned in I’ll work on my technique and timing by using a metronome without the first and third beat. That has been one of the greatest tips ever given to me by the drummer with On-The-Go. It really develops your sense of time. I’ll practice some harmony, scales and arpeggios and I like to play along with my practice playlist. Thanks to SBL, I’ve also started to keep a practice diary every day, and that’s really been a game changer. I’d recommend it to every musician!”<br />
These days Dima is mainly playing gigs in and around Moscow with either new wave punk outfit Rti or indie pop band <a href="http://www.on-the-go.ru/band/"><b>On The Go</b></a>.</p>
<h3>How did you find ScottsBassLessons?</h3>
<p>I just Googled "bass tutorial".</p>
<h3>Tell us about your projects outside of SBL</h3>
<p>I'm busy with several projects right now and I also work as a session musician, but I've been playing with On-The-Go for nearly 5 years. They’re one of the busiest indie-rock bands based here in Moscow. We are in between albums right now and still tour a lot. I’m also in a band that’s at its very beginning. It’s a kind of punk band called Rti, which translates as Mouths. The band is packed with very talented musicians, so it’s a dream team of some sort. We’re recording our first EP right now and there will be a lot of improvisation and trippy solos.</p>
<h3>Who are your favourite players at the moment?</h3>
<p>Oh, there are always so many of them… I really like Pino Palladino's work on the last D'Angelo album. I think those guys are a perfect match and I can't get enough. Yesterday, I listened to one of my favourite new wave albums of all time, which is Rhyme and Reason by Missing Persons. The bass playing by Patrick O'Hearn is just amazing. They’re a very underrated band, and if you haven't heard of them you should definitely check them out!</p>
<p>I've also just discovered Jaco's work with Joni Mitchell and that music is fantastic. As for more recent findings, I really dig the bassist from a UK band called The Invisible. His name is Tom Herbert and you should check out their latest album Patience. Of course, there's also Marcus Miller, Victor Wooten and Larry Graham… the list goes on and on, but somehow pop-music intrigues me more.</p>
<h2>Here’s a great video of The Invisible playing live</h2>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4PFd9x0RDYs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3>Tell us about your gear</h3>
<p>I play a 4-string Japanese Fernandes Burny Jazz Bass with flatwound strings, which give the sound a more vintage tone. My pedalboard varies a lot depending on the project, but for On-The-Go I use a SansAmp Bass Driver or a Boss Bass Driver BB1x, a Shiftline Screamer Deluxe overdrive, a Boss Chorus CEB-3, a Boss Super Octave OC3 and a Boss Chromatic Tuner TU-3. That all fits on a Boss BCB-60 pedalboard. I must thank Shiftline and Roland/Boss Russia for being so kind and supportive.</p>
<h3>What's your best gigging tip?</h3>
<p>I'll paraphrase a tip given to me by Neil Gaiman, who’s a famous comic book creator. He said that when you’re going onstage you should fake it until you make it. Don't get me wrong; you can’t pretend to be a better bass player than you are. That all depends on how much time you’ve invested in your playing, but you can imagine what a great bass player would do before going on at a gig, what they’d do while they’re onstage and also after the gig. Do it over and over, until you start to become that bass player.</p>
<h3>Any career highlights?</h3>
<p>I am a very lucky person and my whole career is progressing step-by-step. I am very grateful to every band I’ve ever played in or am currently playing with. I learn a bit more every day from all of them. My whole career is a highlight thanks to all the great musicians here in Moscow.</p>
<h3>How do you unwind?</h3>
<p>I don't really get myself wound up! I do what I like to do and it’s all connected to music.</p>
<h3>What would you be if you weren’t a bass player?</h3>
<p>I am very dedicated to the bass, but I think I'd just choose another instrument and my life would be just as great.</p>
<h3>What’s been the best thing about 2017 so far?</h3>
<p>Forming the new band, Rti.</p>
<h3>And the worst?</h3>
<p>I didn’t enrol with the SBL Academy until April this year!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/STUDENT_SPOTLIGHT_PABLO_ORELLANA.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17001 size-full" src="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/STUDENT_SPOTLIGHT_PABLO_ORELLANA.jpg" alt="" width="1160" height="516" /></a></p>
<p>For this week’s Student Spotlight, Pablo Orellana shares the story behind his bass approach.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, we’ll be touching base with a diverse set of breaking and established talent to air their thoughts and experiences about bass playing, tunes and music in general from their own vantage point (the only thing that anyone can do, really). Want to join them? If you're studying with SBL and would like to share your experiences, then please don't hesitate to <strong><a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/contact">Contact Us</a></strong> as we'd love to share your story and promote your music to the SBL audience!</p>
<h2>Pablo Orellana - Basses Loaded</h2>
<p>Pressed about his early years as a bass player, Pablo Orellana reveals an unusual starting point: “I started playing in 2007 simply because I liked music. I was just playing songs by The Pixies, but I didn't want to be the main guy in the band, so I gravitated towards the bass. I’m now more comfortable onstage and that’s why I play in as many bands as possible. I play in mostly rock bands that are trying to get known, but I'm not at a professional level yet.” Every player has areas for improvement, though, agrees Pablo. Asked how he’s evolved as a bass player in the time that he’s been a member of SBL, he explains: “After I became an academy member, it was obvious to me that I still had much to learn. I became curious about many things in music, not just with the bass. I take music much more seriously now than I did before and I’ve become a better all-round musician.”</p>
<p>When it comes to gear, Pablo is using modified Fender-style basses. “I have two main basses,” he tells us. “I got one in an auction very cheap and then modified it. The other is a Harley Benton DIY kit. I don't like brands on my instruments and that's why I went with this DIY way of choosing a bass.” A long-time Ampeg player, nowadays Pablo delivers the goods via an amp that’s made by Ermitaño, whose name you may not have heard but who have impressed him greatly. “I had an Ampeg Portaflex PF350 head and a 210 cabinet, but the head died on me, so I replaced it with an Ermitaño bass head, which is made by a local guy here in Chile.” As for pedals, he’s gone for some stalwart options: “I have 5 pedals that I always play with and they’re all covered with stickers! I have a TC Polytune Mini, Aguilar TLC Compressor, MarkBass MB Octaver, Darkglass Duality Fuzz and Z.Vex Basstortion.”</p>
<p>Currently sharing the stage with Parálisis del sueño, Despejado and Bosque Hawaii, Pablo has also been busy putting the finishing touches his own solo project. “I'm currently in 3 bands, which are all in the Chilean underground scene,” says Pablo. “I'm in all of them as a bass player and producer. I also have my own project that I'm working on, but it’s not ready yet.”</p>

<h3>Who are your favourite players at the moment?</h3>
<p>I've always liked bass players that keep it simple. My favourite players are Kim Deal from the Pixies and Adam Clayton of U2. Of the ‘big name’ bass players I would have to choose James Jamerson.There are a couple of players I follow in Chile. They are Silvio Paredes from the band electrodomésticos and SebaBala from Como Asesinar a Felipes</p>
<h2>electrodomésticos</h2>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pak9ojepr24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mEA08qoEGEs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3>How do you practice?</h3>
<p>I used to practice by myself a lot, but lately I spend more time in band practice or composing for my solo project. I should get back to practicing by myself again soon as I miss it!</p>
<h3>What's your best gigging tip?</h3>
<p>Know the songs (or at least some of them!) before showing up for practice. Every time I do this, the band is really impressed and I've never been rejected from a gig. Show up with transcriptions to score extra points.</p>
<h3>Any career highlights?</h3>
<p>I had a gig with a very respectable musician in a big arena for a charity festival. It has a capacity of 15,000 people and there were about 5,000 at the time that we played. It was the hardest I practiced for a show and everybody on the team was happy with my performance, so I hope I get called again!</p>
<h3>How do you unwind?</h3>
<p>I listen to music or play my ukulele.</p>
<h3>What would you be if you weren’t a bass player?</h3>
<p>I have an engineering degree, so I guess I would be in a PhD program somewhere.</p>
<h3>What’s been the best thing about 2017 so far?</h3>
<p>That gig at the charity festival would be my number one, but also the decision to get my solo project going has me very excited.</p>
<h3>And the worst?</h3>
<p>I don't know, band dramas I guess!</p>
<h3>Who would be playing on your fantasy jukebox?</h3>
<p>That’s very hard to answer, but let's see… U2, The Pixies, Jeff Rosenstock, Kaki King, tUnE-yArDs, Bomba Estereo, Como Asesinar a Felipes, Electrodomésticos, (me llamo) Sebastián, Los Tres, St. Vincent, A Tribe Called Quest, Rubblebucket, Laura Stevenson, Open Mike Eagle and many more!</p>

<p>For this week’s Student Spotlight, we catch up with Caleb Wilson.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, we’ll be touching base with a diverse set of breaking and established talent to air their thoughts and experiences about bass playing, tunes and music in general from their own vantage point (the only thing that anyone can do, really). Want to join them? If you're studying with SBL and would like to share your experiences, then please don't hesitate to <strong><a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/contact">Contact Us</a></strong> as we'd love to share your story and promote your music to the SBL audience!</p>
<h2>Caleb Wilson - (Fender) Jazz Master</h2>
<p>Caleb Wilson started out as a guitarist before making the switch to bass while he was still at school. Currently enjoying life at the Academy of Contemporary Music in the UK, there’s no doubt Caleb is geared for bigger stages, but what’s the key to maintaining a happy mindset when you’re spending so much time studying, we ask? “I’ve met so many people at ACM who’ve all got the same passion as me,” says Caleb. “More importantly, there are people here who’ve already done it including one of my personal mentors, Paul Geary (Dire Straits, Paul Young, Nik Kershaw). So it’s great to see what’s actually possible. That’s helped me begin to build up my own reputation.”</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from Sharay Reed, Hadrien Feraud and Michael League, Caleb is currently in the final year of his music degree course at ACM. His love of the bass was rewarded when he was recently asked to play with R&amp;B artist Tyrell Trey. “Tyrell Trey is getting prepared to launch his debut EP and is definitely one to watch!” You can check him out <strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0eOTKADUsPhzLvMra88I69" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></strong></p>
<h3>When did you start playing bass?</h3>
<p>I didn't pick up the bass guitar until Year 9 at school! I actually started on guitar, but the school band didn't have a bassist, so I filled in the position and guess what? I’ve never looked back!</p>
<h3>What first encouraged you to pursue a career as a bass player?</h3>
<p>It's funny because I got straight A’s at school, so when I left at 16 to study music, I’m sure you can all imagine the things people said! My family were supportive of me, which was a big help, but deep down I don't think they actually saw a career in music as a real possibility.</p>
<h3>Who are your favourite players?</h3>
<p>I'm a gospel guy at heart so I listened to a ton of Sharay Reed (if you know the name then you will have seen THE VIDEO), Andrew Gouche and Joe Cleveland. I later discovered Pino Palladino, Jamerson and a band called Snarky Puppy! Man, I’m not a fusion guy, but they opened a new window for me. I then found out about Hadrien Feraud and Janek Gwizdala. Insane players!</p>
<h3>How do you practice?</h3>
<p>With a metronome using loops and backing tracks! I really like to use things in context and break down ideas that I’ve heard to work on my vocabulary and then apply it. I'm currently working on arpeggios and linking progressions smoothly, going through some jazz standards using a great app called iReal Pro. It has backing tracks and charts that you can change the key, tempo and feel - it makes my practice feel a lot more human!</p>
<h3>Tell us about your gear…</h3>
<p>I love Jazz Basses! I have a Fender Jazz Deluxe V and I go through an Aguilar Tone Hammer DI, which was the best £200 I've ever spent! I know I have a great tone going to the PA regardless of the backline. I recently picked up a Sire v7 5-string in natural and this thing just looks and sounds amazing! In fact, I use it more than the Deluxe 5 at the moment! I'm not a massive pedal guy, but I'll occasionally run an octave pedal. I also run synth bass using a Novation Launchkey into Logic or Ableton (I run the Bass Station plugin). I may just have to get the Novation Bass Station II though.</p>
<h3>What's your best gigging tip?</h3>
<p>Be good to be around! From my limited experience so far it seems that being a great person to be around gives you an advantage over other musicians.</p>
<h3>Any career highlights?</h3>
<p>I actually don't finish my degree until this summer 2017, but highlights so far would include playing for 2014 Britain's Got Talent semi-finalist Henrietta Adewole. I also recorded for Incognito's Chris Ballin.</p>
<h3>What would you be if you weren’t a bass player?</h3>
<p>I love sales and that's probably where I would have ended up. I actually used to work for Ralph Lauren, but quit when I realised I could make music work for me and I’d be able to impact more people!</p>
<h3>What’s been the best thing about 2017 so far?</h3>
<p>I actually had a new door open to me into the TV/Film/Commercial industry after doing a photo shoot for the Trinity Rock and Pop grades. I’ve just signed a contract to be booked for TV, Film and Commercial appearances.</p>
<h3>And the worst?</h3>
<p>Cancelled tour dates are always a pain, especially when you block off a portion of your diary for it! But the powers that be would have it that the new door opened just as this one closed!</p>

<p>For our seventh Student Spotlight, we chatted to Krystian Kopec, a bass player whose story with SBL began 18 months ago.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, we’ll be catching up with a diverse set of breaking and established talent to air their thoughts and experiences about bass playing, tunes and music in general from their own vantage point (the only thing that anyone can do, really). Want to join them? If you're studying with SBL and would like to share your experiences, then please don't hesitate to <strong><a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/contact">Contact Us</a></strong> as we'd love to share your story and promote your music to the SBL audience!</p>
<h2>Krystian Kopec - Holly Blue</h2>
<p>“I can pretty much say that I consider Scott my personal teacher and someone who has had a great influence on me as a bass player.” Krystian Kopec couldn’t be more thrilled with his progress as a member of SBL. Holly Blue's latest album, Upbeat, the first recording he’s ever been a part of, is everything that any fan of the Polish electronic trio could possibly want. It encapsulates elements of disco, hook-filled house and ’80s synth pop. “We’ve released two singles from the album,” explains Krystian. “Irresistible and Primitive, which is a cover of a Róisín Murphy song. Both were received better than I expected and we had a nice tour across Poland.”</p>
<p>But life hasn’t always been rosy for Krystian in the Holly Blue camp. Although the core of vocalist Sonia Kopeć and producer Emil Blant has remained constant, Krystian has only recently taken up bass duties. “A friend of mine asked if I wanted to join a project that he was working on,” he tells us. “I had been playing guitar and some piano too, so I was a bit surprised when I heard they were actually looking for a bass player. I told him that I couldn't play the bass and he responded by saying: ‘You’ll learn!’ So that’s what I did.”</p>
<p>This would mark the beginning of a hectic time for Krystian, in which he would go on to become the band’s first choice bassist. “It was quite stressful for me, because there were some upcoming concerts that I was supposed to play and the time was short. I needed to build my technique fast and after the first rehearsal it became clear to me that I needed to be much more disciplined and rhythmically precise. I soon realised that playing in a band and playing alone at my apartment are two very different things! That’s something that Scott really helped me with. I knew that random video lessons on YouTube weren’t enough for me to learn how to play the bass well. But it was thanks to YouTube that I came across scottsbasslessons and that’s when a whole new universe opened up for me.”</p>
<p>Before long, Krystian was ready for his first gig. “After a few months of preparation I started playing with the band. As I became more confident about my playing, I even started composing some material for new songs and the other band members liked it. Upbeat is the first album I’ve ever been involved with and it was like a dream. It’s what I’ve always wanted to do and I am very happy and thankful to Scott and all the people in the SBL team for making it possible.”</p>

<p>In our new weekly feature we’re going to be shining a light on a select few SBL students regarded by many as ‘ones to watch.’</p>
<p>Throughout the year, we’ll be catching up with a diverse set of breaking and established talent to air their thoughts and experiences about bass playing, tunes and music in general from their own vantage point (the only thing that anyone can do, really).

<h2>Kristaps Baumanis - Jack Rabbit Slams / Second Ways</h2>
<p>Another week, another member of ScottsBassLessons has been making some serious waves out there in the real world.</p>
<p>Building a career as a musician is more often than not a balancing act. For many of us, taking that step into the seemingly cut-throat world of today’s music industry often incurs both job insecurity and financial risk. In the case of<b> </b>Kristaps Baumanis, his focus is a simple one. “By day I am actually a PhD student in aerospace engineering,” he laughs. “But by night I’m a bass guitar vigilante!” It’s a familiar situation for many of us, and like so many players coming up these days, Kristaps started out as a guitarist before making the switch to bass. “I played guitar for a few years and during that time I was always living with musicians, but we never had a bass in the flat. So on a whim I bought myself a bass guitar. A month later I had sold my other guitar and I was fully converted.”</p>
<p>Kristaps soon found himself playing along to the likes of Swedish heavy metal band Opeth. “I’ve always been a fan of Martin Mendez with Opeth. That guy plays some really funky bass lines spiced up with some savage death metal fury. Their more recent prog-type stuff is quite cool too.” On the subject of technique, how exactly did Kristaps develop his own playing style? “I should probably have a better practice routine, but I just play loads at home and try to jam with friends as often as possible - being a filthy student instead of having a family has its perks! Lately I've been practising chord tones and jamming along with backing tracks to get more used to playing in certain keys. Learning songs has always been high up on my list of priorities. Hear a cool new tune? Go away and learn it! I’ve been working on some Opeth and Mastodon tunes for a while now and playing that sort of music has also been incredibly beneficial. I don't use tabs, though the temptation is always there.”</p>
<p>‘Practice’ – a word that causes many hearts to sink … Still, it’s always comforting to hear that even established players still put in the time to get their technical skills up to the required level. “I definitely want to play more slap with both of my bands,” Kristaps continues. “I currently play in two bands. One of them is called Jack Rabbit Slams, which is a three-piece rock band. I found these guys on Facebook last year when they were looking for a bassist. I blagged my way through an audition and got it! Here's a video from our first gig. We wrote this song during my audition!”</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/saXaF7I3fo4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The other band is a four-piece called Second Ways. “It’s a reincarnation of an old band I was in while studying for my undergraduate degree,” he tells us. “I’ve been a good friend with the vocalist since day one. I remember him showing me some tunes and I thought it was amazing to know someone who was in a band. Now I get to play those tunes live. It's weird how life sometimes takes you in a direction that you didn’t expect! This is one of the first songs they ever played to me.”</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7Doywmdsc4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>For more information take a look at <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/jackrabbitslams.music/" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/jackrabbitslams.music/</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/secondways/" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/secondways/</a></strong></p>
<h3><b>Why did you choose SBL?</b></h3>
<p>I saw so many videos of Scott plugging his website on YouTube and his persistence got to me! He’s really good at explaining different concepts and he has often made me think of certain topics from a different point of view, which has made things a lot clearer. I signed up about a month after I’d started playing bass.</p>
<h3><b>What has the value of an SBL education meant to you?</b></h3>
<p>Studying <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/courses/harmonic-layering-a-real-world-approach-to-arpeggios-chord-tones-and-scales">harmonic layering</a> has allowed me to become a lot more versatile, but an even bigger part of it has been the community aspect on campus. Having so many good bass players around seeing how people motivate each other has played a really important part in keeping me going.</p>
<h3><b>Who are your favourite players right now?</b></h3>
<p>Last year someone showed me an Austrian Band called Mother's Cake and their bassist Benedikt Trenkwalder is from another planet. If you watch their live record Off The Beaten Track (2012) you can see his versatility really shining through, which you might not hear so much on their studio records. Everything is there and everything is really tight. The other band members are really good too.</p>
<h3><b>Tell us about your gear… </b></h3>
<p>I have two Ibanez basses; a SR505 and a SR750. I'm actually selling the 505 because it's gathering dust and it deserves to be played more, but the 750 I'm definitely keeping because it’s a killer bass. At home, I have a Cougar CBX 100 combo. It's really bulky though and I don't have a car, so I don't use it live. When onstage, I just use my MXR M80 to plug straight into the PA or I’ll use another amp if other bands are sharing backline. The M80 is always in the loop though because I really like the distortion sound. I also have a white Cry Baby Wah, which I've been using sparingly, a Big Muff (which I’m selling soon) and a Boss ODB-3 that I used extensively before I got the M80. It’s a pretty simple rig. In fact, on the last few gigs I've only used the M80 and a tuner pedal, of course.</p>
<h3><b>What's your best gigging tip?</b></h3>
<p>The crowd is not out to get you. They're there to hear you play and they're on your side, so just relax and get lost in the music, but not literally! Do learn the songs before the gig!</p>
<h3><b>Any career highlights?</b></h3>
<p>My career so far has been pretty short, but I guess a highlight was playing King Tuts Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow back in January. It was just a showcase with three other bands, but we ended up just a few tickets short of a sell out crowd. The place was packed. Everyone was super friendly though. I made friends with the sound guy and with the other bands. We also had a dressing room with a fridge full of beers, which was quite a rock ‘n’ roll feeling.</p>
<h3>How do you unwind?</h3>
<p>By playing the bass! I also do some bouldering and am slowly getting into surfing.</p>
<h3>What would you be if you weren’t a bass player?</h3>
<p>If I didn't play bass I'd probably still be playing the guitar. I'm not a full time bass player, so my studies still come first. Sometimes I go to the office and think about playing the bass when I should be thinking about my research!</p>
<h3>What’s been the best thing about 2017 so far?</h3>
<p>I am very excited about this year because of the amount of music I'll have to play! Gigs are just piling up for both bands I play in. And then there’s the new Mother's Cake record, which is called No Rhyme No Reason. It came out on 27/01/2017. It’s amazing!</p>
<h3>And the worst?</h3>
<p>It’s hard to say. This year has been pretty good so far.</p>
<h3>Who would be playing on your fantasy jukebox?</h3>
<p>Is this where I have to come up with a super band? Assuming I can choose musicians that are dead or alive, I'd go for Benedikt Trenkwalder on bass, John Bonham on drums and maybe Frusciante and Josh Homme on guitar? Yves Krismer or Jack White on vocals.</p>

<p>In our new weekly feature we’re going to be shining a light on a select few SBL students regarded by many as ‘ones to watch.’</p>
<p>Throughout the year, we’ll be catching up with a diverse set of breaking and established talent to air their thoughts and experiences about bass playing, tunes and music in general from their own vantage point (the only thing that anyone can do, really). Want to join them? If you're studying with SBL and would like to share your experiences, then please don't hesitate to <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/contact">Contact Us</a> as we'd love to share your story and promote your music to the SBL audience!</p>
<h2>Simon Poulton - Bassist. Dad. Darth Maul Approved...</h2>
<p>Simon’s formative days were spent listening to bands like Cake, Barenaked Ladies and Tool, while toying around with his first bass. “I started playing quite late,” he tells us. “I was around 14 years old when some friends suggested that we start a band. The band didn’t make it and I didn’t start to play seriously until I was 16, which is when I met a local bassist called Lincoln Anderson (now sadly passed away) who was a complete inspiration to me. I’ve never looked back.”</p></div>
<p>Being mainly self-taught, Simon is the first to admit that he prefers to concentrate on the framework of a song before adding his own ideas to it. “My practice routine is slightly more sporadic than I’d like, but it will generally consist of plugging into my 3Leaf Enabler Headphone Amp and either transcribing or learning a particular piece. If I’m learning tunes for a gig then I’ll listen to the song as much as I can. I’ll want to be as familiar with it as possible on the gig, which means learning more than just the root notes.”</p></div>
<p>Asked how SBL has informed his bass playing, he tells us: “For me, as excellent as the educational content is, the community is what’s had the biggest impact on my playing. It genuinely functions as a school/academy with all the community benefits that you’d expect of those institutions. It’s not just a lessons website. ”</p></div>
<p>As for gear, Simon is currently using a 1971 Fender Precision, a Lakland 55-01 and a Lakland Darryl Jones Signature. When it comes to amps, he has a Markbass 801, Little Mark 800 and Little Mark II with Barefaced Bass Super Compact and G2 Midget cabinets. Simon also has a huge number of pedals, including: COG Effects Grand Tarkin, Earthquaker Devices Rainbow Machine, Blakemore Effects Deus Ex Machina Fuzz, Line6 M5, TC Electronic Flashback Mini, Boss VB-2 (Japanese Black Label), Digitech Bass Synth Wah, Electro Harmonix Bass Micro-Synth, Dwarfcraft The Great Destroyer, DOD Meatbox SubSynth Reissue and a Fuzzrocious M.O.T.H. “They’ve all been gigged at some point and my pedalboard is always being swapped around for different projects.”<br />
You can check out Simon’s rock/prog project Corybantic at <a href="https://corybantic.bandcamp.com/releases" target="_blank"><strong>corybantic.bandcamp.com</strong></a>. He can also be found backing up London singer/songwriter JoCee at <strong><a href="http://www.joceesmusic.com" target="_blank">www.joceesmusic.com</a></strong></p>
<h3><b>What first encouraged you to pursue a career as a bass player?</b></h3>
<p>I don’t think I’ve ever consciously tried to pursue a career as a professional bassist, but I have been lucky to have toured and recorded with a wide range of bands and artists.</p>
<h3><b>Who are your favourite players at the moment?</b></h3>
<p>It’s not an exhaustive list, but in no particular order; Richard Bona, Michael League, Liam Wilson, Bobby Vega, Justin Chancellor, Jim Creeggan, Gabe Nelson, Sean Hurley, Pino Palladino, Meshell Ndegeocello, James Jamerson, Bob Babbitt, Esperanza Spalding, Steve Lawson and Lincoln Anderson.</p>
<h3><b>Why did you choose SBL? </b></h3>
<p>I had been subscribing to another named bassist's online lessons website, and while that content was of excellent quality and depth, I was drawn to SBL by the addition of the well-populated and supportive forum of users that has grown around it. I moderate over at basschat.co.uk and I know what a difference a supporting group of people like that can be to whatever end.</p>
<h3><b>What's your best gigging tip?</b></h3>
<p>Always listen to what else is happening onstage, but be visually aware too. If you’re performing to a crowd, you’ll also be interacting with other musicians. If you were talking to them you would probably look at them while doing so, but music is also a language, so I try and treat it in the same way. It also serves a practical function when taking onstage directions if you’re subbing on a gig.</p>
<h3><b>Any career highlights?</b></h3>
<p>Every recording I’ve made thus far is a highlight really. I think it’s increasingly difficult to leave a lasting legacy in life, so to have recorded music that you’re proud of floating around in one form or another is a very nice thought.</p>
<h3><b>What would you be if you weren’t a bass player?</b></h3>
<p>I’d almost certainly be a drummer or I’d build effects pedals. If music simply hadn’t come into the picture, I likely would have pursued a (probably disastrous) sports career as a goalkeeper.</p>
<h3><b>What’s been the best thing about 2017 so far?</b></h3>
<p>Probably the release of JoCee’s debut album, which we started working on in May 2016. While she’s essentially a solo artist, the core band have been with her for around 3 years now, so everyone feels very invested in it, which has only added to the creativity. We also started recording a few weeks after the birth of my son, so the whole process has some great memories. It’s on all streaming and digital platforms, but CD &amp; Vinyl are available too.</p>
<h3><b>And the worst?</b></h3>
<p>Brexit &amp; Trump</p>
