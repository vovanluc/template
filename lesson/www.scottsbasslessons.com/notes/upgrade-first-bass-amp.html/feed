		<description><![CDATA[I always recommend you upgrade your cab first.. I&#039;ve played some less than ideal amps through great cabs and it sounded fine. You can usually make a budget bass sound good enough with a setup and playing to compensate. A cheap amp can surprise you if you have a cab that doesn&#039;t get in the way.  However, a bad cab will give you bad tone every time no matter what any of the other components are. I would probably upgrade cab - bass - amp.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I went through this lesson about a week ago, it didn&#039;t cross my mind, but I always tell teenagers with a new cheap bass or squier guitar they got for Christmas to upgrade the chord post haste. A $59, sometimes on sale as low as $30 Monster chord with gold plated connections are worth a Million Bucks. I have bought Fender chords that snap,crackle, and pop in less than a month, mostly because Fender is not in the chord building business and are selling you a chord made in Asia with a Fender label.. Something about impedence and ohms that I never learned in school, but if you are worried that a similar size chord would set your electric teapot on fire, buy a better chord.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scott,

Very nice summary of your thoughts on upgrading amp before bass.

I have a question regarding your preference on bass cab speaker size (10&quot;, 12&quot;, or 15&quot;) and why. I prefer 10s in a 210 or 410 cab, but have admittedly never done a direct comparison of my 210 cab against a 112. 212, or 115 cab.

Cheers!
