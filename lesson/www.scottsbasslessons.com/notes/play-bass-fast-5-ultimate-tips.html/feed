		<description><![CDATA[I have been wanting to know the answers to this very question, so thank you for this lesson! Practicing these tips now, and yes, they immediately help! I find especially hand position, posture, and light touch make a huge difference.

Where it&#039;s ascending and descending quickly in different intervals, chromatic notes, etc. Do you have any recommendations on how to practice these? Or even books or resources that show written out lines like that to work on.]]></description>
