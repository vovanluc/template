		<description><![CDATA[Scott,
My go-to bass is a custom from a luthier in Iowa, USA, Andrew Drake, it&#039;s 33&quot; scale, myrtle body, wenge neck. It has active Nordstrand pickups in a P/J configuration. I added Audere pre-amp. Other basses in my collection are a 2004 Reverend Rumblefish, these are cult instruments with a phenolic body in a semi hollow configuration, passive Reverend J/J pickups and one of the fastest necks in the world. For fretless playing I constructed a &quot;FrankenBass&quot; using the body of a Fender modern player hollowbody Starcaster and a custom 32&quot; fretless neck, I had custom passive pickups wound by Sentell, and added Stellartone tone pots, I keep either roundwound or nylon tapewounds on it. I have a Traveler Guitar TB-4p, which is compact and fits in airplane overhead bin so I always practice on vacation. Oh, and just for fun, I have a Schecter 32&quot; scale Gibson SG shaped prototype with two passive Thunderbird style soapbox pickups. The common theme is medium scale necks for smaller hands and fingers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yo Scott,
Love the sound of that Ibanez. Some basses just have loads of personality. I&#039;ve got a 305 5 string myself, I love it because the action is perfect ( although it does go a bit high at the top end ). Also it only weighs about 5 pounds !
I&#039;ve had a Fender U.S.A Elite precision for a few months, but I&#039;m scared to play it in case it breaks !]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My oldest right now is a j-bass I call the Mexican. About 15 yo. Built at a time when Fender was only building in Mex. and Cal.  #2 is my &#039; 63 P Bass copy with 1/4 pounders

#3 I also built a J bass with 1/4 pounders to test out those  on a J. It is my &quot;Glam&quot; bass finished in a sparkle gold finish. All else on it are black, including the strings. Forgot to mention my &#039;63&#039; P also has black strings. I am coo-coo for Rotosound strings, which are probably made right down the street from you. #4 I had never seen a P&#038;J bass and thought I was inventing it. Then I saw Danny Mo, so in his honor (and my disappointment) made the P&#038;J in flat black. It has Roto&#039;s  Steve Harris custom flats. The Mexican has Roto&#039;s Swing Bass 66,s, round 45-105. If you want deep bass these are E strings of 105-110-115. If I could find bigger, but not made of rubber I would have them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Scott, I&#039;ve got a Dean Brian Bromberg signature, a relative rarity I believe, as they released it before he thought it was ready, and he pulled out of his links with Dean. Problem with it is that it weighs a ton, it&#039;s active, but has two batteries, not one, as it has active eq, and they don&#039;t tell you about the second, hidden, battery - it took a while to work that out!  I&#039;ve also got an Eko acoustic, short neck, but a nice practice instrument.  I also have what used to be a Peavey Millenium, until I took it apart, changed the electrics, put in some EMG jazz pickups, took the frets out of the neck and painted it bright blue!﻿  The Dean and the home  made both have flats, and the acoustic has round copper strings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think I&#039;ve played just about every odd thing in the 50 years I&#039;ve been playing but right now I&#039;m using :

A custom-made passive 5-string Maruszczyk Jake (P-Bass) with P and JJ Haeussel pickups for the rock band,
A custom-made active fretless 5-string Maruszczyk Frog with Delano eXtenders and a Glockenklang 3-band preamp for the 70&#039;s style proggy band, 
A 4-string passive Maruszczyk Elwood (Jazz) with classic 60s Fender pickups - just for hacking around on ... 
An old Active Korean 5-string fretless that kept me going for several years
An ancient hand-built custom active 5-string that I love and keep just for nostalgia reasons and played on and off since 1990]]></description>
