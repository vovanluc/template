<p>You may or may not know but I've just released a brand new course into the SBL Academy course library... and it's HUGE!</p>
<p>In fact, it's probably the most detailed and in depth course focusing on scales, arpeggios and chord tones in existence, coming in at over 10+ hours long!</p>
<p>This lesson is a sneak preview of a lesson from the new course. I'm going to walk you step by step through using one of my favorite ever scales - "The Blues Scale"</p>
<p>Now I know you might have messed around with the blues scale before, but trust me - there's a lot of cool stuff you can do with it that you probably don't know about...</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)<br />
</p>
<p>PS. If you enjoy this lesson and really want to become a "scales/arpeggios ninja" on the bass you should check out our 10+ hour  course, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/harmonic-layering-arpeggios-chord-tones-scales" target="_blank">"<em>Harmonic Layering - A Comprehensive Guide To Chord Tones, Arpeggios &amp; Scales"</em></a>.</p>
<p>It's probably the most thorough scales and arpeggio course that's ever been created coming<br />
in at 10+ hours long... I literally take you step by step through everything I know on the<br />
subject, leaving no rock unturned. It's ALL in there.</p>
<p>Within the new course I cover arpeggios, chord tones, scales, pentatonic scales, the modes, uses of more exotic scales, but most importantly - I show you how to use all of these elements to create awesome bass lines, grooves and solos.</p>
<p>​In other words - I not only show you everything I know, I also show you how to actually use this information in <em>real life situations</em>!</p>
<p>In fact the lesson you're about to watch is part of that course! :) Check it out <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/harmonic-layering-arpeggios-chord-tones-scales" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For this "Bass Riff of the Week" I wanted to cover a basic riff, but spice it up by giving it a 6 over 4 feel. Essentially this means although the riff itself isn't overly complex or tough to play, getting the timing and feel correct can be a bit of a pain especially if you haven't played in a 6 over 4 feel before.</p>
<p>The first time I heard this type of feel was while listening to "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teisGt6sv3w">African Skies</a>" by the late great saxophone player Michael Brecker. The track has Dave Holland on upright, Jack DeJohnette on drums, and simply blew my mind when I heard it for the first time! I just couldn't understand why I could count 4, but also count 6 at the same time... this is the first time this concept entered my life, and ever since that moment i've had a deep interest and relationship with it in all it's different forms and permutations.</p>
<p>The gag is, once you start being able to hear this super imposition of 6 over 4 you're going to start hearing everywhere. It's one of the most common time super impositions there is, and by getting it into your toolkit it's really going to give you a deeper and fatter groove across all different time feels - not just 6 over 4.</p>
<p>Oh... and drummers LOVE it too, so whenever they start hinting at it within their groove you can jump on it with them.</p>
<p>To go even further with these types of feels I recommend actually putting your bass down and concentrating on multiple clapping exercises - this gives you the chance to forget about notes for a while and concentrate purely on rhythm. This was HUGE for me. I can't put into words how much this changed my playing...</p>
<p>In fact a few weeks ago in one of the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/sbl-insider-pro">SBL Academy LIVE Q&amp;A sessions</a> I talked about how I discovered this by pure accident and also showed the different clapping exercises I used. That particular Q&amp;A session was over 2 hours long and is in the "bass hang" archive within the Academy. If you haven't checked the SBL Academy out yet... <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/sbl-insider-pro">it's here</a>.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For this weeks “Riff of the Week” i’ve used part of the riff from one of my favourite Erykah Badu songs “Annie Don’t Wear No Panties” and then added my own little twist on the end to keep you on your toes ;)</p>
<p>You can hear Erykah’s <a href="http://youtu.be/9d9eydCfTdw">live version here</a> with the awesome Braylon Lacey on bass.</p>
<p>The original riff is based around a C minor tonality with an added 9th which gives it that extra hip sound. The more altered line i’ve added at the end of the riff is based on super imposing a G7 altered chord over the C minor. You can either look at this part of the riff as being derived from the G altered scale, the Ab melodic minor scale or even the Abminor/major 7th arpeggio—as they actually all contain the same notes. This gives the latter part of the riff a strong “out” sound which is commonly heard in jazz improvisation.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed… Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this new bass lesson, I'm taking you through a lick that we can play over an E minor 7th chord or over its relative major chord which is G Major 7th.</p>
<p>I'll be showing you what triads and <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">arpeggios</a> I'm using, so you're not only learning a new lick but you can also expand on that and build your own lines.</p>
<p>Remember that although learning a ton of licks is better than learning nothing ;), if you understand how a lick is built, you'll be much better equipped to create your owns and, more generally, you'll become a much better musician, not just a "<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/video-bass-lesson-ii-v-i-jazz-lick-2.html">lick player</a>".<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the following bass lessons, I hope to give you some melodic tools that will help you improvise within static chordal grooves and modal tunes like 'So What' and 'Impressions'. There are many ways to approach soloing over static minor chords and modal harmony on the bass. The techniques I have chosen to discuss within the following tutorials have really helped my students break away from playing the same old 'licks' as well as given them the option of playing 'in' and 'out' of the harmony with the correct techniques to do so. Remember, be patient and methodical with your bass practice. Get in the shed and good luck! S.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>‘HOW TO SOLO OVER MINOR A II V I CHORD PROGRESSION’ BASS LESSON SHOWS YOU HOW TO APPROACH SOLOING AND IMPROVISATION OVER THIS COMMON TURNAROUND ON THE BASS GUITAR.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/solo-over-ii-v-i-progression.html">major II V I's</a> minor II V I's were a real mystery for me. I had trouble playing over them so I always reverted to a certain set of licks to get me through while improvising. So, enough was enough... I sat down for a month with my bass and a stack of records and began to transcribe and theorize. After a lot of coffee and cigarettes (this was a long time ago, I am now a ex-smoker... expect for at friends parties when I've consumed far to much wine!) I finally figured how people were improvising over the minor II V I turnaround and how to apply it to the bass guitar. I saw the same <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-scales.html">scale</a> are <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">arpeggio</a> substitutions coming up over and over and have put these video tutorials together to demonstrate them.</p>
<p>Learning to play over this progression and being able to use the different substitutions available is an invaluable practice method and is something that will really help every aspect of your playing. Be patient and methodical within your practice, it sometimes takes a while for your ear to get used to the sound of certain substitutions. Soon you will start to hear the substitutions discussed in these tutorials in many of the solo’s you have listened to or transcribed in the past. Trust me, this is a great experience, it's like someone just switched the light on!<br />
Get in the shed and good luck! S.</p>
<p>Oh, and another thing!… Watch out for my new book ’The Linear Harmony Concept For Bass Guitar’ which covers my unique way of approaching soloing on the bass and how to practice the different techniques involved. Due for release VERY soon!</p>
