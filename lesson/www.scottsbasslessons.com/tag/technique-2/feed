<p>I’ve seen countless bass players struggling with their <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy/online-bass-courses/technique-deep-dive-bass">technique</a> - they can’t seem to play faster type lines or make big stretches on the fingerboard… in fact stretching any more than 4 frets is a struggle for them.</p>
<p>In most cases <em>bad positioning</em> is at the root of all these problems.</p>
<p>Positioning your bass correctly whilst sitting or standing is absolutely vital. Not only could it hold your bass playing back in ways you may not realise, but even more seriously than that it can effect your health.</p>
<p>In this lesson I’m going to show you some <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy/online-bass-courses/technique-deep-dive-bass">techniques</a> to help you find the perfect bass position.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
</p>
<p>PS. If you enjoy this lesson and really want to become a "technique jedi" on the bass you should check out our full technique course within the <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy" target="_blank">Academy</a>. It’s over 2 hours long and includes the very exercises I developed working with hundreds of students over the years, and ultimately completely changed my bass playing.</p>
<p>In fact the lesson you're about to watch is part of that course! :) Check it out <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy/online-bass-courses/technique-deep-dive-bass" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mixing <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html">plucking</a> and <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/slap-bass-lesson.html">slapping</a> techniques on the bass is something that I rarely see discussed, but is used extensively by many of the worlds top bass players. You’ll have heard it used on many records thousands of times before, most likely without even noticing it as it’s something that can go under the radar so easily even though it’s a huge reason why the bass line sound so damn funky :)</p>
<p>In this lesson I deconstruct the bass line from the famous Jocelyn Brown tune “Somebody Else’s Guy”. This is a perfect example of two different plucking techniques being used in conjunction with each other to give the bass line that “slap bass” feel, but still with the control and tightness of a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/bass-right-hand-muting-floating-thumb.html">finger style bass</a> line.</p>
<p>“Somebody Else’s Guy” was the first song I started using within my practice time to get used to swapping between <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/slap-bass-lesson-the-sectret-triplet-technique.html">slapping</a> and plucking techniques within the same bass line. Initially it’s a lot trickier that you might think as it’s easy to start rushing the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/creating-bass-grooves.html">groove</a> when swapping between the two styles.</p>
<p>Good luck…</p>
<p>And as always, see you in the shed!</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this lesson I'm going to explain why getting together with friends to practice and jam with is a key part of your progression as a bass player and musician. Once I started to meet up with other musicians for group practice sessions and jams my bass playing started to progress faster than ever before. In fact I'd argue that most of my "big leaps" happened while playing with other musicians. This isn't to say that practising on your own isn't important... it's absolutely invaluable and something you must be doing if you want to push your bass playing to the next level! But, playing with other musicians is also extremely important, and if you're not doing it on a regular basis yet I urge you to give it a try.</p>
<p>Now grab you're bass and get in the shed!</p>
