				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Using chromatic approach notes within my bass lines and grooves is one of my favorite techniques. Ever.</p>
<p>To say I use it a lot would be a serious understatement... I use is ALL the time, in pretty much everything I play.</p>
<p>I first picked up on the approach note technique when I was transcribing solos by guys such as Charlie Parker and Miles Davis, but later when transcribing bass players such as <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/palm-muting-lesson.html">James Jamerson</a>, <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/notes/bob-babbitt-interview.html">Bob Babbit</a> and <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/notes/carol-kaye-lesson.html">Carol Kaye </a>I found that they were also using the same technique extensively within their bass lines.</p>
<p>In this weeks bass riff of the week I thought I'd create a riff that was based around the chromatic approach note technique so you could see and hear it in action. I also slipped in a cool descending triadic lick at the end of the groove that was inspired by Michael League, bass player from Snarky Puppy (a band you need to check out if you haven't already!). He uses a lot of triadic ideas within his bass lines, so I've been shedding them over the last few weeks myself as I love the sound of them so much... and they sound killer on my P bass ;)</p>
<p>You can download the full TAB and notation by hitting the link directly under the video... plus you'll get the play-along track too.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. I also just wanted to say a massive thanks to all of you that left the amazing feedback about the solo bass singles I've released over the last few weeks. Reading your comments totally blew me away! :)</p>
<p>If you haven't heard them yet, you can hear "smile" <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/live-sessions/scotts-solo-bass-sessions-smile-charlie-chaplin.html">here</a>... and "Autumn Leaves" <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/live-sessions/scotts-solo-bass-sessions-autumn-leaves.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>I've received a ton of email since the <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/live-sessions/scotts-solo-bass-sessions-smile-charlie-chaplin.html">first single</a> was released asking whether I'd ever be creating a course covering how to play chords on the bass and how to master chordal arrangement. Well... the simple answer is... yes I will!</p>
<p>I'll be releasing a full course covering chords into <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">The Academy</a> at the end of November. If you're already an Academy member this course will be added to your membership automatically as soon as it's released. If you're not already a member... shoot <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">over here</a> and check out <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">The Academy</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you've watched my lesson '<a title="Simple Shapes on the bass #2" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/shapes-on-bass-2.html">Using Simple Shapes on the Bass #2</a>', perhaps you remember that it dealt with those 'sexy notes' that have a special flavor to them, that kinda<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/beginners/bass-tip-2-ear-training.html"> surprise our ear</a>, but in a nice way, well... at least for most of us.</p>
<p>In this new bass lesson, I'm showing you a very simple bass lick that does exactly that: the reason why it sounds so good is that it adds an element of surprise --that will probably get you a lot of 'wows' by the way!</p>
<p>The surprise comes from the fact that it includes a lot of notes that don't 'fit' in the expected harmony: most of the notes are not directly related to the G minor chord that we're playing over. As a result, there's a 'tension and release' effect that makes us feel good. Well, check out for yourself! ;)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, I'm going to show you a little chromatic bass lick that's often used to link up chord tones / phrases. If you haven't watched my lesson called <a title="Chord Tones Exercice" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/chord-tones-bass-exercise.html">Chord Tones / One Position Exercise</a>, do check it out too!</p>
<p>As you probably know by now, I'm not particularly in favour of learning a ton of licks and trying to use them everytime it seems to 'fit in'. I think it's much more profitable to spend a reasonable amount of time figuring out 'how music works'. That's how you'll really become a better and more versatile musician, and you'll be able to play different styles of music with different people, get more gigs, etc.</p>
<p>That said, I'm not fiercely 'anti-licks' either! Not at all. They definitely have their place in your practice and knowing a variety of bass licks comes in very handy in many situations.</p>
<p>This is the case of the chromatic lick I'm showing you in this lesson, that allows you to target chord tones --link chords… chromatically. Very simple, very useful! Ready? Go!</p>
