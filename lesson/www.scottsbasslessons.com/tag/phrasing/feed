				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok, i'll get straight to the point. The exercise I show you within this lesson completely changed the way I play the bass. It forced me to start thinking in way that is much more musical and dynamic - and less in the "paint by numbers" style I was playing in before. I say "painting by numbers", as before I started using this exercise I was just "plugging in" licks into whatever I was doing - this exercise made that impossible to do.</p>
<p>When this exercise was originally shown to me by the great bass educator Bruce Gertz from the Berklee School of Music, I though "Huh, that sounds so easy... why doesn't he show me something 'really' technical... I'm ready for it... I can take it!". I mean seriously, this exercise seemed so simple on paper - but when I tried to put it into action... it brought me to my knees!</p>
<p>I was impossible!</p>
<p>Too hard!</p>
<p>Completely Turned my brain to soup!</p>
<p>I simply couldn't use any of the licks, tricks and dips (hey, it rhymed) i'd been using before.</p>
<p>Because this exercise was about linking my comping lines and soloing lines in a way that was much more organic than i'd ever done before, it meant that I HAD to learn a new way of thinking... and the exercise forced me to do so.</p>
<p>A quick word of warning...</p>
<p>This exercise took me a long time master. I would guess it took at least a month before I felt like I was getting a handle on it, and bare in mind I was using this exercise every day - 5 days a week. So when you first start using it... don't worry, I have been through the same pain! ;)</p>
<p>In closing, If you're just starting out on the bass, you should make a note of this exercise and revisit it at a later date. If you've been playing a while I really recommend you start using this within your practice time as soon as you can as it has the power to completely change the way you play the bass.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the second Jazz phrasing bass lesson in this series.<br />
<span style="font-size: medium;">If you haven't watched the first one, please check it out <a title="Jazz Phrasing Bass Lesson #1" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/jazz-phrasing-video-bass-lesson-1.html">here</a></span></p>
<p>In this lesson we'll go on working with <em>Blue Bossa</em> which is very well-suited for our purposes.</p>
<p>So let's see how we can develop our phrasing on this tune, keeping in mind that all this information is transferable not only to other chords but also to a lot of different tunes.</p>
<p>Want savvy phrasing? What about "intervallic relationships"? If you've never heard it before, don't feel overwhelmed and click the play button! Hopefully, this lesson will make it much clearer…</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I'm gonna be talking about jazz phrasing in the context of bass soloing.</p>
<p>But what is... "phrasing"?</p>
<p>Well, to put it simply, it's just like when you're talking: there's <em>what</em> you say, the words you use, etc. and <em>how</em> you say it --rhythm, intonations, breathing… Have you ever ever been told "It's not what you say! Its HOW you say it!" ;) Have you ever heard a speaker who made you feel drowsy after 30 seconds and another one who kept you all ears during his entire speech?</p>
<p>Same thing with music and soloing, for that matter. Obviously you don't need me to tell you that you can even play the exact same notes and make it sound great or death boring. What I'd like to show you in this series of bass lessons is what you should focus on specifically if you want to improve your soloing skills.</p>
<p>There are many related lessons on this website, but two of them come to my mind right now, that perhaps you should watch, if you haven't already: the first one is about <a title="Letting the Snare Drum Breathe…" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/letting-snare-drum-breathe.html">Letting the snare drum breathe</a>, the second one on <a title="Right Hand Dynamics on Bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-dynamics.html">Right Hand Dynamics</a>.</p>
