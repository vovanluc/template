				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this lesson, I'm talking about the major scale and why you should learn it. If you are a beginning bass player and you've heard this term "<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-scales.html">scales</a>", you're probably asking yourself "What is a major scale?". Well, it's something you've heard since you were a little kid: it goes do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do and down… So a scale is just a sequence of notes played up and down. It can be major or minor, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/using-pentatonic-scales-1.html">pentatonic</a> or anything else, but don't worry about that yet: in this lesson I'm only covering the major scale.</p>
<p>Now you're probably asking yourself why you should learn scales instead of just playing bass lines. Well, you'll do both, but the reason why scales are so important is because they are the foundation of any melody, as I'm showing you in this video. Learning them will not only improve your technique dramatically, it will also allow you to better understand music and not "just play bass lines". Actually it will make your bass lines much better! When you're finished with this lesson, check out my lesson on how to <a title="Bass Scales practice" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/practice-bass-scales.html">practice scales on the bass</a>.</p>
<p>But, one step at a time, let's explore the major scale!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/using-pentatonic-scales-3.html">previous lesson</a>, I began to talk about learning your pentatonic scales in different positions --on your bass, I mean, not sitting and standing ;). And this is <em>really</em> important because, as with any scale, if you know it in only one position or pattern, you'll get stuck!!!</p>
<p>So you have to learn them starting from different positions / fingers, and I recommend starting with three positions. Let's take the C major pentatonic scale for example: we can start playing it with the second finger on the C, then starting with the fourth finger on the C, and lastly with the second finger on the D.</p>
<p>Once you've learned that patterns, what you wanna do is practice going up in one position then down in another, and vice-versa. Practicing that way will give you a <em>much</em> better mastery of your pentatonic scales and, more generally, of your fretboard!</p>
<p>Btw., this doesn't apply only for the pentatonic scales, it applies for <em>any</em> scale. So if you haven't watched my lesson on <a title="How to Practice Bass Scales" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/practice-bass-scales.html">how to practice bass scales</a>, I highly recommend you do so!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this third lessons about using pentatonic <a title="How to Practice Bass Scales" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/practice-bass-scales.html">scales on the bass</a>, I'm taking another lick that can be played over our chord sequence, which was: A minor / Bb Major / C Major (2 bars).</p>
<p>Actually, it's a <em>really</em> common lick that you've probably heard on several funk records! But still, it sounds good, and, like the previous one, it can be 'dissected' and used in different ways.</p>
<p>But <em>unlike</em> the previous one, that was played in just one position, this one is going across three different positions. It's still a C Major pentatonic scale we're using, but played in different positions on the neck.</p>
<p>I'll do another tutorial talking about learning pentatonic scales in different positions on the bass, but... that's another tutorial. Let's have a look at this second lick first!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is my second lesson in this series about using pentatonic scales in your bass lines.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because of the tonality of these five-note scales, pentatonics are very versatile and can be used in all sorts of ways and styles of music --pop, rock, funk, jazz… you name it.</span></p>
<p>In the <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/using-pentatonic-scales-1.html">previous tutorial</a>, we took a very simple chord sequence that goes: A minor / Bb Major / C Major (2 bars) and we've seen that pentatonic scales can sound really cool. After this lesson, I got a lot of emails saying things like 'I kept hearing this kind of melody --or lick… what were you doing exactly there?" etc.</p>
<p>So what I wanna do in this lesson is take one of those pentatonic licks and show you how I 'dissect' it to build other licks, rather than playing the exact same one over and over again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pentatonic scales are widely used in almost every style of music, so much so that they're often called the 'bread and butter' of the bass player!</p>
<p>In this lesson, I'm showing you how you can get pentatonic scales into your bass lines and what they are good for. I'm also discussing how to adapt them, depending on the style of music you're playing.</p>
<p>Basically, a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/beginners/beginning-the-major-scale.html">major pentatonic scale</a> is very much like the major scale, except it misses out the 4th &amp; the 7th, leaving us with just 5 notes (penta = five). The minor pentatonic scale misses out the 2nd and the 6th and sounds much more bluesy or jazzy.</p>
<p>Then, we'll see how we can use both minor and major pentatonic scales over a simple chord sequence. Have fun! ;)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This important lesson shows you <strong>how to learn and use arpeggios on the bass</strong>, by applying my 'linear harmony concept' and, most importantly, shows how this concept can actually be applied to other areas of music!</p>
<p>Ok, we've all been told it's imperative for us to practice our arpeggios and <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-scales.html">scales</a> on the bass, but what you might not have been told is that what's incredibly important <em>how</em> you practice them. Running arpeggios up and down the neck is fine, but just doing this will not really have any great effect on your playing.</p>
<p>By practicing them using my 'continuous arpeggio exercises' (explained in the following video tutorials), you will find that chord tones really unlock the mysteries of the fretboard. You'll actually start 'seeing' the chord tones all over the neck which in-turn will stop you having to jump around the fingerboard unnecessarily as you will have whatever harmony you need under your fingers wherever you are on the neck.</p>
<p>As well as transforming the way you 'see' harmony on the neck these exercises are also an amazing ear training tool as well! By applying these exercises to your regular practice time you will start hearing the arpeggios in all there different inversions which in turn will help the development your ear.</p>
<p>These exercises are hard and it will take a lot of practice... but it really will transform your bass playing and your understanding of harmony. Work them into your daily practice routine and you will start to see the benefits. Good luck in the shed! S.</p>
