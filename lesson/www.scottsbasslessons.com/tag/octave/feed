				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This lesson was completely impromptu… in fact, it wasn’t even supposed to be a lesson.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago in The Campus (the community forum within the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/sbl-insider-pro">SBL Academy</a>) we had an awesome discussion going on about <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/gear/the-pedal-board.html">effects pedals</a>, so originally I planned to simply show you my two favourite ‘go-to’ effects pedals, but then half way through I just thought “What the heck… I need to show you guys this cool lick!”…</p>
<p>So this video is not only about pedals… it’s also about playing those super cool synth type bass runs that the likes of Stevie Wonder use extensively.</p>
<p>I don’t really talk about gear too much as it’d be really easy for you to forget that you’re here to become a better bass player, not spend more $$$ on gear! But when it comes to <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/gear/the-pedal-board.html">effects pedals</a> I think they’re really worth exploring as they can add to your pallet of sounds and give you some different sonic elements to use within your bass lines. For instance you can see how I get my 4 string to sound like a 5 string by using a cool little trick with an <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/notes/how-to-make-your-4-string-sound-like-a-5-string.html">octave pedal here</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that many of the artists and bands right now are using keyboards for the low-end instead of a regular bass, so if you’re working professionally as a bass player it’s likely that you will be called upon to recreate these sounds. If you have basic keyboard skills you could use a synth, but my keys skills leave a lot to be desired which is why I choose to recreate these synth type sounds using my regular bass and manipulating the sound with different effects pedals.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this lesson, I'm showing you an octave string skipping exercise for your plucking hand that complements the lesson on <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html">right hand</a> --or plucking hand technique that deals with <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html ">alternate plucking and raking</a> and also the one on <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/bass-right-hand-muting-floating-thumb.html">string muting</a>. If you haven't watched these lessons, please do so before you watch this one: it's mandatory that your plucking/raking/muting be good enough before you practice skipping strings.</p>
<p>The exercises I'm showing you in this video consist of playing octaves up and down and across the neck. The <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-and-left-hand-positioning.html">fretting hand</a> pattern is very simple and easy to memorize so you can concentrate on your plucking hand: it's very important that you play evenly and cleanly.</p>
<p>As always, start slowly and increase the speed as you go, tracking your progress with a metronome. As soon as it becomes "sloppy", decrease the speed --and take a rest if needed, the goal of these exercises is not to kill your wrists ;).</p>
