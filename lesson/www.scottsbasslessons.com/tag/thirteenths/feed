				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As bass players we have many roles to play within a band or ensemble, and creating a strong foundation and groove needs to be high within our priorities.</p>
<p>At times this can mean staying out of the way harmonically, so the rest of the band can do their thing without the bass line getting in anyone's way by being too busy or harmonically rich.</p>
<p>This is great for the rest of the band, but sometimes this can make you feel un-inventive with your bass lines and grooves... in a way, almost like you can't be a part of the creative harmonic process.</p>
<p>Don't worry, you're not alone... until I found a few little tricks (that i'll show you in the lesson below) I felt the exact same way.</p>
<p>But... there's hope! :)</p>
<p>By using specific intervals on certain chord types we can be harmonically creative with our bass lines without the fear of treading on anyone else's toes within the band or ensemble.</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to take you through which intervals will give you this freedom and the specific chord types they relate too.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
