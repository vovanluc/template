				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Understanding and using triads within your bass lines is really going to help you grow not only a bass player but also as a musician. Triads are chords in there most simplistic form. As bass players we can utilize the triads within our bass lines and from doing so it helps us expand on the information we already have available under our fingers on the fretboard. Remember... it's important to understand why we play the notes we play and not to just play by ear. If you're just '<a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/beginners/bass-tip-2-ear-training.html">playing by ear</a>' it's like making a speech or talk about a topic you don't really understand... all it takes is a little practice and you'll get it!</p>
<p>So... get in the shed! ;)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this third lesson, I'm expanding on what we've seen in the two previous lessons on how to develop and expand bass lines. So if you haven't watched them already, please do so! Lesson 1 is <a title="Expand &amp; develop your bass lines #1" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/expand-develop-bass-lines-part-1.html">here</a> and lesson two is... <a title="Expand &amp; develop your bass lines #2" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/expand-develop-bass-lines-part-2.html">there</a> ;).</p>
<p>The chord progression we're working on is from John Mayer's "Perfectly Lonely" and goes: C Major / F Major / D minor / G7.</p>
<p>We've seen how we can play from the root and then play the thirds, the fifths and then target them chromatically. In this tutorial, I want to talk about displacing the root note, which means NOT playing it on the first beat of every bar, as you've probably been used to. Note that it's perfectly ok to do so, but you don't have to do it all the time. Displacing the root note from time to time can definitely sound really good. But check by yourself!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this lesson, we continue working on developing &amp; expanding bass lines over John Mayer's "Perfectly Lonely". If you haven't seen the <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/expand-develop-bass-lines-part-1.html">first tutorial</a> of this series on expanding &amp; developing your bass lines, please check it out and then come back to this one.</p>
<p>So, if you remember, the tune is basically a 4-chord sequence: C Major / F Major / D minor / G7. In the first lesson, we began using the roots (duh!), then adding the 5ths and then the 3rds --which can be Major or minor.</p>
<p>In this second lesson, I'm talking about "targeting the notes chromatically", i.e. targeting the 5ths chromatically and then targeting the 3rds chromatically. Of course you can also target the roots in the same way! Sounds confusing on "paper"? Then, watch the vid and you'll see it's actually quite simple and sounds pretty cool!</p>
<p>You may also want to watch my lesson on <a title="How to Target Chord Tones Chromatically" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/target-chord-tones-chromatically.html">targetting chord tones chromatically</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this lesson I show you how you can start to expand and develop bass lines.</p>
<p>The tune I use as an example is John Mayers 'Perfectly Lonely' which originally has Pino Palladino playing on it. - Check him out if you haven't already!</p>
<p>This series will show you --if you're not already convinced, that you DON'T need to play a ton of different notes to make a bass line sound good. Sure you can always expand further at a later stage, but let's start with the simple stuff: roots, thirds and fifths and see what we can get out of them!</p>
