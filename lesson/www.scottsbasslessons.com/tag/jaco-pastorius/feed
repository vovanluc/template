				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The tune "Teen Town" was written by the legendary bass player and composer <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/study-piece-donna-lee.html">Jaco Pastorius</a> and was one of the stand out tracks on the 1977 "Heavy Weather" album recorded by the boundary breaking jazz ensemble Weather Report. For me, it's not only one of the most important compositions i've ever studied, but in a way, at the time of first discovering the works of Weather Report and Jaco Pastorius, it is one of the most important compositions i've ever heard as it completely changed the way I viewed the bass guitar and how the instrument could function within an ensemble.</p>
<p>In this lesson I take this legendary composition and break it down piece by piece, phrase by phrase. This not only gives you the chance to learn the tune, but even more importantly it gives you the chance to start to understand exactly why it works harmonically, and the way the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/the-importance-of-melody.html">melody</a> fits within the chords as they pass by.</p>
<p>If you haven't used <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/study-piece-donna-lee.html">study pieces</a> before, now's the time to start. By taking a composition such as this and studying it over an extended period of time looking into the technical and harmonic challenges within it, it gives you a different type of focus and learning experience. It's all about the long game, it's not about being able to play it straight way and moving onto the next shiny object. IfÂ focused and thorough you'll be rewarded with bass awesomeness ;)</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first heard the legendary bassist Jaco Pastorius my life was changed forever. Up until that moment the only bass players I'd ever really heard were simply doubling up the guitar line or simply grooving in the background.</p>
<p>I first heard him playing on the tune 'Havona' by Weather report, and still to this day his performance on that recording blows my mind. I strongly urge you check it out after you've watched this lesson.</p>
<p>The thing that made Jaco Pastorius stand out for me was his 16th note style grooves. They were so rhythmically powerful but at the same time had a melodic depth that I hadn't heard any other bassists reach.</p>
<p>In this bass lesson I have constructed a groove that demonstrates exactly how to use these 16th note type grooves and most importantly how you can get them into your own playing vocabulary.</p>
<p>You may also want to check out this lesson on <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/teen-town-jaco-pastorius.html">Teen town</a></p>
<p>As always... see you in the shed!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donna Lee was recorded by legendary bassist <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/teen-town-jaco-pastorius.html" target="_blank">Jaco Pastorius</a> in 1978. It was at this point that the perceived role of the bass guitar was changed forever! And, when I first heard this groundbreaking recording my life was also changed forever!</p>
<p>Because the electric bass guitar is such a new instrument, as yet there aren't really any true 'study pieces' within the 'bass repertoire'. For this reason I love to get my students to use be-bop heads as study pieces. Because they were originally composed for horns such as saxophone and trumpet they can be challenging on so many different levels. Fingering position, speed, technical fluidity and dynamics all need to be taken into account.</p>
<p>Within this tutorial I discuss why we, as bass players need to use 'study pieces' within our practice time, and how they can have a huge affect on your overall technical ability and fluidity upon the bass.</p>
<p>Now grab your bass and get in the shed!</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. I do completely live bi-weekly streamed workshops for the members of <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">The Academy</a> where I go through exercises just like this and tons of other juicy stuff that'll get your bass playing to the next level.
