				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Muting with the left hand to get a shorter attack from the note and giving your bass lines a more vintage feel, is something I only came across a few years ago.</p>
<p>I originally discovered this technique when watching a video of the great bassist and educator Danny Mo Morris (who's now one of the many world-class educators teaching within the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">SBL Academy</a>), but soon after I saw many bass players using the exact same technique such as the great gospel bass player Sharay Reed and the power house of groove behind the band Tower of Power, Rocco Prestia.</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to show you this cool left hand muting technique in detail, and also tell you how it pretty much saved my bass playing career!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. You can download the play-along track, TAB &amp; notation directly under the video. If you're an <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">SBL Academy member</a> you can also download the full video file so you can watch these lessons offline plus the audio only version too.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this tutorial I'm talking about right and left hand positioning: I see soooo many players with a terrible hands positioning… they'll probably end up with a RSI --Repeated Strain Injury, which is not cool at all and can keep you away from your bass for weeks or months.</p>
<p>If you haven't seen my <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/beginners/strap-height.html"> tutorial about strap height</a>, please check it out before you watch this video: as you can guess, your strap height will greatly condition your right and left hand positioning. So save yourself from bad habits and injuries and watch <a title="Strap height on bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/beginners/strap-height.html">this video</a> if you haven't and then come back here.</p>
<p>Basically, what you want to avoid is to have an excessive bend in your wrists that would put a lot of strain on your tendons and ultimately cause an injury. Be careful: you might not feel it right from the start, but after hours of playing --not necessarily in a row, believe me, you most certainly would!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the second part of my lessons on building speed and accuracy on the bass. So if you haven't seen the <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/build-speed-accuracy-on-the-bass-1.html">first part</a>...</p>
<p>In the previous lesson, we worked on descending the C <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/beginners/beginning-the-major-scale.html">major scale</a>, breaking it down into chunks of increasing size, adding one note at a time. In this lesson, we're going into the exact same process, but ascending. Again… if you haven't seen and practiced my <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html">lesson on alternate plucking</a>, please do so, otherwise you won't be able to apply what I'm showing you here.</p>
<p>Don't forget that playing fast is a combination of things, among which good plucking/raking technique and economy of movement, both for your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html">plucking hand</a> and fretting hand. Keep your movements as "small" as possible: the farther your finger is away from the string, the longer it takes to reach it. Makes sense? ;)</p>
<p>Again, spend as much time as needed on a 4 or 5 or 6-note chunk, increase the speed gradually, relax, breathe, take rests… Don' worry, speed <strong>will</strong> come with time and practice!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speed… Almost every learning bassist wants to play faster, which is understandable, but don't forget that speed is something you <strong>build</strong> day after day and it mustn't be at the expense of accuracy. Actually, trying to play <em>too</em> fast, i.e. play much faster overnight, can cause mental and physical blocks that will slow down your progress.</p>
<p>So, what can you do to <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/double-your-speed.html"><strong>build</strong> your speed</a>? Break things down, not your tendons! Generally, string crossing is a problem when you're trying to play faster. So, if you haven't seen my lessons about right hand technique, <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html">raking &amp; alternate plucking</a>, <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/octave-string-skipping-right-hand-exercise.html">string skipping (octaves)</a> and <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/bass-right-hand-muting-floating-thumb.html">right hand muting</a>, please do check them out before you try to apply what I'm showing here!</p>
<p>In this lesson, we're going to work on a C major scale, first descending, then ascending, breaking it down into sections which size will increase by one note at a time: 3 notes, then 4 notes, 5 notes, etc. Remember it's not a problem at all if you spend one week playing just five notes! If you want to play (well) faster… take your time!</p>
