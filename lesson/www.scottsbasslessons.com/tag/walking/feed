				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok, i'll get straight to the point. The exercise I show you within this lesson completely changed the way I play the bass. It forced me to start thinking in way that is much more musical and dynamic - and less in the "paint by numbers" style I was playing in before. I say "painting by numbers", as before I started using this exercise I was just "plugging in" licks into whatever I was doing - this exercise made that impossible to do.</p>
<p>When this exercise was originally shown to me by the great bass educator Bruce Gertz from the Berklee School of Music, I though "Huh, that sounds so easy... why doesn't he show me something 'really' technical... I'm ready for it... I can take it!". I mean seriously, this exercise seemed so simple on paper - but when I tried to put it into action... it brought me to my knees!</p>
<p>I was impossible!</p>
<p>Too hard!</p>
<p>Completely Turned my brain to soup!</p>
<p>I simply couldn't use any of the licks, tricks and dips (hey, it rhymed) i'd been using before.</p>
<p>Because this exercise was about linking my comping lines and soloing lines in a way that was much more organic than i'd ever done before, it meant that I HAD to learn a new way of thinking... and the exercise forced me to do so.</p>
<p>A quick word of warning...</p>
<p>This exercise took me a long time master. I would guess it took at least a month before I felt like I was getting a handle on it, and bare in mind I was using this exercise every day - 5 days a week. So when you first start using it... don't worry, I have been through the same pain! ;)</p>
<p>In closing, If you're just starting out on the bass, you should make a note of this exercise and revisit it at a later date. If you've been playing a while I really recommend you start using this within your practice time as soon as you can as it has the power to completely change the way you play the bass.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the first two lessons of this walking bass 'crash course', we've been practicing on a sequence with only one chord per bar.</p>
<p>Quick recap: in the <a title="Walking Bass Crash Course 1" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/walking-bass-lines/walking-bass-crash-course-lesson-1.html">first lesson</a>, we've played 'only' roots, fiths &amp; thirds and 'passing notes'. In the <a title="Walking Bass Lines Crash Course 2" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/walking-bass-lines/walking-bass-crash-course-lesson-2.html">second lesson</a>, we've added more chromatic notes. Hopefully you've practiced that, explored the variety of options that this gives you, and you're beginning to create walking bass lines that sound really good! Don't forget your <a title="Walking Bass - Improve Your Swing Feel!" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/rythm/walking-bass-swing-feel.html">swing feel</a> is key!</p>
<p>In this lesson, we're going to work on sequences with 2 chords per bar. Nothing to worry about... That's easy and fun! ;)</p>
<p>We're going to take a I-VI-II-V turnaround in the key of C. The chords are: C Major, A minor, D minor, G7. This turnaround is a <em>very</em>common one, so what you'll be learning here will be transposable to many many tunes.</p>
<p>I highly recommend you to practice over backing tracks! If you've got good backing tracks with piano &amp; drums or guitar &amp; drums, great! If not, you may be interested in my <a title="Backing Tracks for Bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/backing-tracks-bass">backing tracks packages</a> available. Actually, these packages are much more than just backing tracks, but I let you discover them if that's of interest to you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This series of walking bass lessons show you an easy-to-understand and easy to put into practice method to create walking bass lines.</p>
<p>This is the second part to my 'crash course' in <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/free-video-bass-lessons/walking-bass-lines/">walking bass lines</a>. As I said in the earlier tutorial, there's a lot to learn when it comes to creating good walking bass lines, but these lessons should get you on the right path as fast as possible, so you can start applying these concepts in real playing situations.</p>
<p>In the first video, we talked about using just root, 3rd, 5th and 'passing note' (one semi-tone below or above the first note of the next chord).</p>
<p>We've done that on <em>Autumn Leaves</em>, which is a great tune to start with. If you haven't already done so, you can download the lead sheet I've provided with the <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/walking-bass-lines/walking-bass-crash-course-lesson-1.html">first lesson</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully you've realised that we can create very nice walking bass lines using just these notes, especially if we use all the 3rds, 5ths and octaves available --i.e. above AND below. I recommend you practice just that for a while, exploring the different options available, before moving to the next step.</p>
<p>Done? So... next step! Very simple: we're going to add more chromatic notes, ascending and descending, to add a little bit more diversity to our walking bass lines. And if your <a title="Walking Bass - Improve your Swing Feel" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/rythm/walking-bass-swing-feel.html">swing feel"</a> is good, it should begin to sound the business ;).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These <strong>walking bass lessons</strong> show you an easy-to-understand and easy to put into practice method of creating a walking bass line.</p>
<p>In my younger years, I found myself in an awkward situation where I was asked to play some jazz type <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/free-video-bass-lessons/walking-bass-lines/">walking bass lines</a> for a band I was in... At the time I had NO IDEA how to create a walking bass line, so I had to come up with something fast that to get me out of trouble, keep the band happy and ultimately not get me the sack lol! (Getting the sack would have been even more complicated as the band I was working for was a full time pro band on a cruise ship... I might have got stranded in Barbados!... actually that sounds quite good!).</p>
<p>This is a quick tutorial explaining what walking bass lines are and more importantly how to get 'up and running' with them without having to get into too much theory.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When playing <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/walking-bass-lines/walking-bass-beginner-2.html">walking bass lines</a>, your feel is absolutely key to make everything 'sit' as it should within the context of whichever ensemble you're playing. The exercises presented within this lesson should help you on your way to strengthening your internal clock and improving your walking bass swing feel.</p>
<p>Whether you've already watched my other <a title="Walking Bass Series" href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/walking-bass-lines/walking-bass-beginner-1.html">lessons on walking bass</a> or not, this one is very important: you can play all the 'right' notes, simple or more sophisticated walking bass lines, if your swing feel isn't good enough, it's gonna sound like... well, it won't sound as good as it should. ;)</p>
