				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>You may or may not know but I've just released a brand new course into the SBL Academy course library... and it's HUGE!</p>
<p>In fact, it's probably the most detailed and in depth course focusing on scales, arpeggios and chord tones in existence, coming in at over 10+ hours long!</p>
<p>This lesson is a sneak preview of a lesson from the new course. I'm going to walk you step by step through using one of my favorite ever scales - "The Blues Scale"</p>
<p>Now I know you might have messed around with the blues scale before, but trust me - there's a lot of cool stuff you can do with it that you probably don't know about...</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)<br />
</p>
<p>PS. If you enjoy this lesson and really want to become a "scales/arpeggios ninja" on the bass you should check out our 10+ hour  course, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/harmonic-layering-arpeggios-chord-tones-scales" target="_blank">"<em>Harmonic Layering - A Comprehensive Guide To Chord Tones, Arpeggios &amp; Scales"</em></a>.</p>
<p>It's probably the most thorough scales and arpeggio course that's ever been created coming<br />
in at 10+ hours long... I literally take you step by step through everything I know on the<br />
subject, leaving no rock unturned. It's ALL in there.</p>
<p>Within the new course I cover arpeggios, chord tones, scales, pentatonic scales, the modes, uses of more exotic scales, but most importantly - I show you how to use all of these elements to create awesome bass lines, grooves and solos.</p>
<p>​In other words - I not only show you everything I know, I also show you how to actually use this information in <em>real life situations</em>!</p>
<p>In fact the lesson you're about to watch is part of that course! :) Check it out <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/harmonic-layering-arpeggios-chord-tones-scales" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok, i'll get straight to the point. The exercise I show you within this lesson completely changed the way I play the bass. It forced me to start thinking in way that is much more musical and dynamic - and less in the "paint by numbers" style I was playing in before. I say "painting by numbers", as before I started using this exercise I was just "plugging in" licks into whatever I was doing - this exercise made that impossible to do.</p>
<p>When this exercise was originally shown to me by the great bass educator Bruce Gertz from the Berklee School of Music, I though "Huh, that sounds so easy... why doesn't he show me something 'really' technical... I'm ready for it... I can take it!". I mean seriously, this exercise seemed so simple on paper - but when I tried to put it into action... it brought me to my knees!</p>
<p>I was impossible!</p>
<p>Too hard!</p>
<p>Completely Turned my brain to soup!</p>
<p>I simply couldn't use any of the licks, tricks and dips (hey, it rhymed) i'd been using before.</p>
<p>Because this exercise was about linking my comping lines and soloing lines in a way that was much more organic than i'd ever done before, it meant that I HAD to learn a new way of thinking... and the exercise forced me to do so.</p>
<p>A quick word of warning...</p>
<p>This exercise took me a long time master. I would guess it took at least a month before I felt like I was getting a handle on it, and bare in mind I was using this exercise every day - 5 days a week. So when you first start using it... don't worry, I have been through the same pain! ;)</p>
<p>In closing, If you're just starting out on the bass, you should make a note of this exercise and revisit it at a later date. If you've been playing a while I really recommend you start using this within your practice time as soon as you can as it has the power to completely change the way you play the bass.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Playing "out" is something that I obsessed about for around three years. I loved the sound of it but just couldn't figure out how players were doing it when they were soloing. Guys such as Allan Holdsworth, Skuli Sverrisson, Gary Willis, Jerry Bergonzi... they were tearing it up with these "out" sounding solo lines and it just sounded so damn hip!</p>
<p>But, as with everything as soon as I figured out what people were doing to get the "out" sound i thought "wow, that's pretty simple... how come it took me this long to figure it out!"</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to explain exactly what playing "out" is and show you a few techniques that will help you get that sound into your playing.</p>
<p>See you in the shed!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I used to get so frustrated when soloing over a one chord groove. I just kept running out of ideas! It was when I was transcribing a bass solo of Jeff Berlin's that I discovered a super cool way of using the same information I already new, and simply moving the shapes into different keys - thereby getting a whole new sound and flavor over one chord... without having to do too many brain gymnastics! :)</p>
<p>In this bass lesson I'm going to let you in on what I learned and exactly how you can use it in your playing!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Improvising over multiple chord changes can be a daunting task. It can be challenging to be creative when playing over only one chord, but when there is 2, 3 or even 4 chords it's easy for your mind to get tied in knots - and instead of making great music, being melodic and hitting some sexy notes ;)... you're too busy just trying to hit 'some' of the right notes and hoping that there's not too many wrong notes</p>
<p>In this bass lesson I'm going to introduce you to 'Shape Shifting'. You're going to learn how you can alleviate some of the issues you'll have when playing over chord changes by simply shifting patterns on the fretboard. This technique can be used on many different chord sequences, but for this lesson we're going to concentrate on shape shifting over the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/solo-over-ii-v-i-progression.html">Major II V I</a> turnaround.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this bass lesson you're going to learn how to use intervalic shapes and patterns within your bass solos, and how important they can be.</p>
<p>When you listen to a great bass player soloing it can seem effortless, almost like the notes and ideas are just flowing out of them. Well that's true to a certain extent, but there is ALWAYS method behind the madness ;)... everything they're playing within there solo is interval related and I guarantee they'll be either thinking of that while playing, or more likely be 'hearing' that while playing. Either way, there is a thought process behind it. Imagine if you spoke without actual thinking about what you were speaking about about... it'd sound pretty strange wouldn't it! Just random words! Well soloing or simply just playing the bass is just the same - there needs to be some sort of thought process behind it otherwise it would just sound like a random mess of notes.</p>
<p>Using intervallic ideas within your soloing lines can really start to open up the sound and texture of your solos and help you break away from just running up and down scales aimlessly. Getting these types of ideas into your soloing lines is a must, and once you do you'll start to hear that EVERYONE... sax players, piano players, you name it - they use these same techniques!</p>
<p>This lesson will take your bass soloing to the next level!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This lesson is all about melody! As bass players, we generally play… bass lines most of the time, rather than melodies. So if you're not used to soloing, it can be a pretty scary experience at first, because you're not used to playing melodies.</p>
<p>Even if you know all your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-scales.html">scales</a>, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">arpeggios</a>, etc. you probably won't know what to do with them when you first start soloing. Everything will probably sound very rigid, simply because… you're not used to playing melodies!</p>
<p>So, let's take a well-known melody and see what we can get out of it. We'll start playing the melody completely straight with the metronome --that is without 'pushing' or 'pulling' and, when we're comfortable with that, I'll show you what I mean by pushing and pulling against the metronome.</p>
<p>Then you can take any melody that comes to your mind and play with it in the same way. Not only is that fun, but it will improve your soloing big time!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is part 2 of my bass lessons about what I call 'The Gary Willis approach', in which I'm talking about a specific lesson Gary and I went through together when I was studying with him.</p>
<p>If you haven't seen the 1st part of this lesson, please go check it out, otherwise you'll most certainly wonder what on earth I'm talking about!</p>
<p>What we're gonna do is work on substituting major pentatonics on the minor 7th chords, using the standard <em>Blue Bossa</em>.</p>
<p>Translation… The first two bars of Blue Bossa consist of a C minor chord. Over this C minor chord, we're gonna use the first substitution I talked about in part 1, which is the major pentatonic a minor 3rd above the root note of the chord. In this case, the chord being a C minor, we're gonna play an Eb major pentatonic scale.</p>
<p>Then we've got two bars of F minor. So we're gonna do exactly the same and play an Ab major pentatonic scale, etc. 'Etc.' meaning that this stuff looks much more complicated in writing than it is in reality so, if I've managed to whet your appetite and not discourage you, what about watching this long video? ;)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gary Willis has to be one of the most virtuosic, original and unique sounding bass players of the last twenty years. From his early work with Wayne Shorter, the groundbreaking fusion band Tribal tech through to his more recent projects like Triphastic, his bass playing is never less than breathtaking. I was lucky enough to study with him in Barcelona for just over the duration of a year, an experience I will never forget!</p>
<p>Among all the lessons I took with Gary there was one that particularly stood out. In fact it was from this very lesson that all my further lessons with him seemed to be directly connected to. It was almost the foundation of my study with him.</p>
<p>This specific lesson covered the superimposition of major pentatonic scales on top of minor chords and other more complex chord sequences from the jazz standard repertoire. Not only was this eye opening for me, but it also gave me a great insight into why Gary Willis sounds so unique and is instantly recognizable in his soloistic approach.</p>
<p>The superimposition of major pentatonic scales within a soloing/improvisational environment is a large contributing factor to the ‘Gary Willis’ sound. If this is something you want to be able to access and use in your own improvisations I suggest starting with static minor chord vamps to begin with, and then later on when you feel confident doing that move onto more complex chord progressions.</p>
<p>See you in the shed ;)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this new bass lesson I'm going to show you a nice lydian jazz lick you can play over a Major 7th chord.</p>
<p>What's interesting about this one, is that there's a sharp 11th in it, which creates the "tension". If something makes you think of the Simpson's, that's because of this very tension note.</p>
<p>If you're not used to hearing 11th (or 4th) played over Major 7 chords, it will probably create… tension in your body, which is the point! But after a time, you'll get used to it and it should be a nice tension.</p>
<p>If you haven't watched my lesson <a title="How to Practice Arpeggios on the Bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">How to learn Arpeggios on the bass</a>, it might be a good idea to do so: in this lesson, I'm showing you how you should learn your arpeggios starting from different fingers --index, major and pinky. Here we're gonna use the "third position" (starting from the pinky).</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the second Jazz phrasing bass lesson in this series.<br />
<span style="font-size: medium;">If you haven't watched the first one, please check it out <a title="Jazz Phrasing Bass Lesson #1" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/jazz-phrasing-video-bass-lesson-1.html">here</a></span></p>
<p>In this lesson we'll go on working with <em>Blue Bossa</em> which is very well-suited for our purposes.</p>
<p>So let's see how we can develop our phrasing on this tune, keeping in mind that all this information is transferable not only to other chords but also to a lot of different tunes.</p>
<p>Want savvy phrasing? What about "intervallic relationships"? If you've never heard it before, don't feel overwhelmed and click the play button! Hopefully, this lesson will make it much clearer…</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I'm gonna be talking about jazz phrasing in the context of bass soloing.</p>
<p>But what is... "phrasing"?</p>
<p>Well, to put it simply, it's just like when you're talking: there's <em>what</em> you say, the words you use, etc. and <em>how</em> you say it --rhythm, intonations, breathing… Have you ever ever been told "It's not what you say! Its HOW you say it!" ;) Have you ever heard a speaker who made you feel drowsy after 30 seconds and another one who kept you all ears during his entire speech?</p>
<p>Same thing with music and soloing, for that matter. Obviously you don't need me to tell you that you can even play the exact same notes and make it sound great or death boring. What I'd like to show you in this series of bass lessons is what you should focus on specifically if you want to improve your soloing skills.</p>
<p>There are many related lessons on this website, but two of them come to my mind right now, that perhaps you should watch, if you haven't already: the first one is about <a title="Letting the Snare Drum Breathe…" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/letting-snare-drum-breathe.html">Letting the snare drum breathe</a>, the second one on <a title="Right Hand Dynamics on Bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-dynamics.html">Right Hand Dynamics</a>.</p>
