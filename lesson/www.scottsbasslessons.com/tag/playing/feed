				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Playing "out" is something that I obsessed about for around three years. I loved the sound of it but just couldn't figure out how players were doing it when they were soloing. Guys such as Allan Holdsworth, Skuli Sverrisson, Gary Willis, Jerry Bergonzi... they were tearing it up with these "out" sounding solo lines and it just sounded so damn hip!</p>
<p>But, as with everything as soon as I figured out what people were doing to get the "out" sound i thought "wow, that's pretty simple... how come it took me this long to figure it out!"</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to explain exactly what playing "out" is and show you a few techniques that will help you get that sound into your playing.</p>
<p>See you in the shed!</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you've even felt that you're "bluffing" a little when you're trying to solo (I know I used too!), in this lesson I'm going to to give you three great exercises that will give you more confidence when soloing, give your solos a more melodic feel and sound to them , plus give you way more control over your note choice and fretboard knowledge.</p>
<p>As always, grab your bass and I'll see you in the shed!</p>
