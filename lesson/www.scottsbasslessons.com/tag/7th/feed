				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here's another bass lick you can play over major-7th type chords.The <a title="Jazz Lick for M7 Chords #1" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/licks/jazz-lick-major-7th-type-chords-1.html">previous one</a> was built mainly over the C major <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">arpeggio</a>. This one uses quite a few chromatic notes, for a change. Nothing really complicated but watch your fingering!</p>
<p>We'll learn this lick in B flat major but as always, don't hesitate to transpose it in other keys. Also, experiment and see how you could apply it, i.e. what you could play before and after and remember that these bass licks you learn are not supposed to be an end in themselves but rather to be a springboard.</p>
<p>So, again, you've got to understand how they're constructed so you can create your own, putting together various ideas and adding your personal touch / inspiration. Always look at the bigger picture.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you probably know by now, ScottsBassLessons is <em>not just</em> about licks, grooves and chops… What I'm striving to do here is to give you a 'non-reductive' approach to learning and playing the bass.</p>
<p>That said, I'm not '<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/video-bass-lesson-ii-v-i-jazz-lick-1.html">anti-lick</a>' at all! What I'm saying is that it's not <em>enough</em> to learn a ton of bass licks, particularly if you want to be able to play with other musicians. But learning bass licks and grooves is a part of your musical education and you'll benefit even more from learning if you understand how they are constructed, so you can create your owns.</p>
<p>So today I'm going to show you a simple jazz lick for <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/jazz-lick-major-7th-type-chords-1.html">Major 7th</a> type chords. It's built mainly over the C major arpeggio --btw. have you watched my lesson <a title="Practice Arpeggios on the Bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">practicing arpeggios on the bass</a>? When I say it's simple, I mean the way it's constructed is very simple, but make sure you use appropriate fingerings, by copying mine, for example. ;)</p>
