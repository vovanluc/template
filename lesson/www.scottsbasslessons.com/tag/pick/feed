<p>Using a plectrum to play bass!...</p>
<p>Surely not?! ;)</p>
<p>Well actually, if you're aiming to be a versatile and in demand bass player you certainly should be able to play bass using a plectrum (also commonly referred to as a pick).</p>
<p>Just as an example of how effective using the plectrum can be when playing bass I recommend checking out Carol Kaye, Bobby Vega, Chris Squire, Steve Swallow and Justin Chancellor. All are phenomenal bass players... and all of them play with a plectrum.</p>
<p>Unfortunately playing bass with a plectrum has a certain stigma attached to it. In the past I've heard crazy statements such as "you're not a real bass player if you play with a pick"... which is completely untrue. In the video below I explain where this stigma has originated from - and why you should completely ignore it.</p>
<p>With many of students I've worked in the past with I've seen constant bad habits and incorrect techniques when using a plectrum. In this lesson I'm going to show you 4 exercises that you can apply straight away to help you clean up your picking technique.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"Is it a good thing or a bad thing to play with a pick?" is a question I'm asked quite often by my students. Perhaps because they haven't seen me playing with a pick (or plectrum) in any of my bass lessons? ;)</p>
<p>The short answer is that it's neither 'good' nor 'bad': you're not 'cheating' if you're using a plectrum, it just gives you a different sound. Actually I think it's a good thing to practice both with and without a plectrum right from the start, not to limit yourself.</p>
<p>So this lesson deals with the basics of using a pick --downstrokes, upstrokes, alternate picking but also gives you little tips and tricks to practice and get a great sound!</p>
<p>So grab a pick and get in the shed! ;)</p>
