				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this lesson, I'm talking about the major scale and why you should learn it. If you are a beginning bass player and you've heard this term "<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-scales.html">scales</a>", you're probably asking yourself "What is a major scale?". Well, it's something you've heard since you were a little kid: it goes do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do and down… So a scale is just a sequence of notes played up and down. It can be major or minor, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/using-pentatonic-scales-1.html">pentatonic</a> or anything else, but don't worry about that yet: in this lesson I'm only covering the major scale.</p>
<p>Now you're probably asking yourself why you should learn scales instead of just playing bass lines. Well, you'll do both, but the reason why scales are so important is because they are the foundation of any melody, as I'm showing you in this video. Learning them will not only improve your technique dramatically, it will also allow you to better understand music and not "just play bass lines". Actually it will make your bass lines much better! When you're finished with this lesson, check out my lesson on how to <a title="Bass Scales practice" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/practice-bass-scales.html">practice scales on the bass</a>.</p>
<p>But, one step at a time, let's explore the major scale!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this third lesson, I'm expanding on what we've seen in the two previous lessons on how to develop and expand bass lines. So if you haven't watched them already, please do so! Lesson 1 is <a title="Expand &amp; develop your bass lines #1" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/expand-develop-bass-lines-part-1.html">here</a> and lesson two is... <a title="Expand &amp; develop your bass lines #2" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/expand-develop-bass-lines-part-2.html">there</a> ;).</p>
<p>The chord progression we're working on is from John Mayer's "Perfectly Lonely" and goes: C Major / F Major / D minor / G7.</p>
<p>We've seen how we can play from the root and then play the thirds, the fifths and then target them chromatically. In this tutorial, I want to talk about displacing the root note, which means NOT playing it on the first beat of every bar, as you've probably been used to. Note that it's perfectly ok to do so, but you don't have to do it all the time. Displacing the root note from time to time can definitely sound really good. But check by yourself!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this lesson, we continue working on developing &amp; expanding bass lines over John Mayer's "Perfectly Lonely". If you haven't seen the <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/expand-develop-bass-lines-part-1.html">first tutorial</a> of this series on expanding &amp; developing your bass lines, please check it out and then come back to this one.</p>
<p>So, if you remember, the tune is basically a 4-chord sequence: C Major / F Major / D minor / G7. In the first lesson, we began using the roots (duh!), then adding the 5ths and then the 3rds --which can be Major or minor.</p>
<p>In this second lesson, I'm talking about "targeting the notes chromatically", i.e. targeting the 5ths chromatically and then targeting the 3rds chromatically. Of course you can also target the roots in the same way! Sounds confusing on "paper"? Then, watch the vid and you'll see it's actually quite simple and sounds pretty cool!</p>
<p>You may also want to watch my lesson on <a title="How to Target Chord Tones Chromatically" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/target-chord-tones-chromatically.html">targetting chord tones chromatically</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this lesson I show you how you can start to expand and develop bass lines.</p>
<p>The tune I use as an example is John Mayers 'Perfectly Lonely' which originally has Pino Palladino playing on it. - Check him out if you haven't already!</p>
<p>This series will show you --if you're not already convinced, that you DON'T need to play a ton of different notes to make a bass line sound good. Sure you can always expand further at a later stage, but let's start with the simple stuff: roots, thirds and fifths and see what we can get out of them!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here's another bass lick you can play over major-7th type chords.The <a title="Jazz Lick for M7 Chords #1" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/licks/jazz-lick-major-7th-type-chords-1.html">previous one</a> was built mainly over the C major <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">arpeggio</a>. This one uses quite a few chromatic notes, for a change. Nothing really complicated but watch your fingering!</p>
<p>We'll learn this lick in B flat major but as always, don't hesitate to transpose it in other keys. Also, experiment and see how you could apply it, i.e. what you could play before and after and remember that these bass licks you learn are not supposed to be an end in themselves but rather to be a springboard.</p>
<p>So, again, you've got to understand how they're constructed so you can create your own, putting together various ideas and adding your personal touch / inspiration. Always look at the bigger picture.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you probably know by now, ScottsBassLessons is <em>not just</em> about licks, grooves and chops… What I'm striving to do here is to give you a 'non-reductive' approach to learning and playing the bass.</p>
<p>That said, I'm not '<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/video-bass-lesson-ii-v-i-jazz-lick-1.html">anti-lick</a>' at all! What I'm saying is that it's not <em>enough</em> to learn a ton of bass licks, particularly if you want to be able to play with other musicians. But learning bass licks and grooves is a part of your musical education and you'll benefit even more from learning if you understand how they are constructed, so you can create your owns.</p>
<p>So today I'm going to show you a simple jazz lick for <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/jazz-lick-major-7th-type-chords-1.html">Major 7th</a> type chords. It's built mainly over the C major arpeggio --btw. have you watched my lesson <a title="Practice Arpeggios on the Bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">practicing arpeggios on the bass</a>? When I say it's simple, I mean the way it's constructed is very simple, but make sure you use appropriate fingerings, by copying mine, for example. ;)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've received quite a bunch of e-mails asking me about <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/solo-over-ii-v-i-progression.htmlhttp://">II-V-I bass licks</a> that happen within one bar (actually, it's generally the "II-V" that happens on one bar). The previous II-V-I's I've showed you were on 3 or 4 bars: one bar on the II, one bar on the V and one or two bars on the I.</p>
<p>So, in this lesson, I'm giving you a couple of bass licks that you can use on these II-V's. I'm also talking about the 'tritone substitution' that you can use for more diversity &amp; contrast: it adds a lot more tension before we resolve to the I chord.</p>
<p>Remember that the bass licks I'm giving you are supposed to be a starting point: after you've tried them in various keys, experiment and create your owns, using the lick I'm giving you as a springboard, an idea-triggerer… That's how you will progress and develop your own style.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here's a new lesson showing you another II-V-I bass lick, this time in the key of Eb. As I said many times before --but I'm saying it again in case you didn't hear it…, once you're comfortable playing a bass lick in one key, stretch yourself a little and practice it in all keys. You won't regret it, as you'll become a <em>much</em> better player doing so!</p>
<p>Within this lick, I use a variety of 'tension notes' to spice things up a little! Tension-Release, Tension-Release… ;)</p>
<p>Again, I highly recommend you practice over backing tracks, <a title="Backing Tracks for Bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/backing-tracks-bass">the ones I have packaged</a> for you or others, but make that a habit, it's <em>really</em> invaluable!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>‘HOW TO SOLO OVER A II V I CHORD PROGRESSION’ BASS TUTORIAL SHOWS YOU HOW TO APPROACH SOLOING AND IMPROVISATION OVER THIS COMMON TURNAROUND ON THE BASS GUITAR.</p>
<p>Coming up with new and interesting ways of soloing over a II V I progression on the bass can be a great way to spend an afternoon... or a lifetime! This chord progression is probably the most frequently used turnaround in music. It can be heard in all styles from pop and jazz to funk and classical. It is used extensively in jazz standards so it's important that you not only understand it, but know how to approach it from a soloing and improvisational stand point as well.</p>
<p>Learning to play over this progression and being able to use the different <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-scales.html">scales</a> and <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">arpeggio</a> substitutions is an invaluable practice method for soloing on the bass and is something that will really help every aspect of your playing. Be patient and methodical within your practice, it sometimes takes a while for your ear to get used to the sound of certain substitutions. Soon you will start to hear the substitutions discussed in these tutorials in many of the solo's you have listened to or transcribed in the past.</p>
<p>Here is a list of just a few standards that use a lot of II V I's. Take a look at the lead sheets for them and see if you can apply some of the substitutions I discuss in the following video tutorials.... Autumn Leaves, All the things you are, Stella by Starlight, The Days of Wine and Roses, Beautiful Love, I Love You, Alone Together, What Is This Thing Called Love.</p>
<p>Get in the shed and good luck! S.</p>
<p>Oh... and of course, I highly recommend you practice over <a title="Backing Tracks for Bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/backing-tracks-bass">backing tracks</a>, be it mine or others you may have.</p>
