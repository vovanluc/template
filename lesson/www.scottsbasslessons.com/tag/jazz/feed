				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Improvising over multiple chord changes can be a daunting task. It can be challenging to be creative when playing over only one chord, but when there is 2, 3 or even 4 chords it's easy for your mind to get tied in knots - and instead of making great music, being melodic and hitting some sexy notes ;)... you're too busy just trying to hit 'some' of the right notes and hoping that there's not too many wrong notes</p>
<p>In this bass lesson I'm going to introduce you to 'Shape Shifting'. You're going to learn how you can alleviate some of the issues you'll have when playing over chord changes by simply shifting patterns on the fretboard. This technique can be used on many different chord sequences, but for this lesson we're going to concentrate on shape shifting over the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/solo-over-ii-v-i-progression.html">Major II V I</a> turnaround.</p>
<p>Grab you're bass and get in the shed! Scott</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is part 2 of my walking bass lessons for the beginner jazz bass player, You can find <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/walking-bass-lines/walking-bass-beginner-1.html">Part 1 here</a>. In this lesson I expand on what we looked at within the first lesson and get you to start walking 4 in a bar using chord tones and chromatic passing tones.</p>
<p>When trying out these exercises remember - making it 'feel' good is SUPER important... if you're playing all the correct notes but your feel just isn't happening then that's going to be a big issue in the future. So... Feel, feel and more... FEEL!</p>
<p>Now get in the shed!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Walking bass is something SOOO many bass players have difficulty with. But - It's really a lot easier than you think and hopefully, this series of walking bass lessons will help remove the confusion!</p>
<p>Through years of teaching and experimenting with different methods I've come up with my own 'fool proof' method of getting students well on their way to becoming great at creating their own walking bass lines.</p>
<p>In this walking bass lesson I show you how I actually teach my own personal students using this method and why they seem to be able to start creating there own walking bass lines much faster than most other students. That's why this lesson is great not only for student bassists but also bass teachers too. Try using this method with your students and you'll get amazing results - fast.</p>
<p>This is 'Part 1' of this lesson... <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/walking-bass-lines/walking-bass-beginner-2.html">check out Part 2</a>!!!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the first two lessons of this walking bass 'crash course', we've been practicing on a sequence with only one chord per bar.</p>
<p>Quick recap: in the <a title="Walking Bass Crash Course 1" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/walking-bass-lines/walking-bass-crash-course-lesson-1.html">first lesson</a>, we've played 'only' roots, fiths &amp; thirds and 'passing notes'. In the <a title="Walking Bass Lines Crash Course 2" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/walking-bass-lines/walking-bass-crash-course-lesson-2.html">second lesson</a>, we've added more chromatic notes. Hopefully you've practiced that, explored the variety of options that this gives you, and you're beginning to create walking bass lines that sound really good! Don't forget your <a title="Walking Bass - Improve Your Swing Feel!" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/rythm/walking-bass-swing-feel.html">swing feel</a> is key!</p>
<p>In this lesson, we're going to work on sequences with 2 chords per bar. Nothing to worry about... That's easy and fun! ;)</p>
<p>We're going to take a I-VI-II-V turnaround in the key of C. The chords are: C Major, A minor, D minor, G7. This turnaround is a <em>very</em>common one, so what you'll be learning here will be transposable to many many tunes.</p>
<p>I highly recommend you to practice over backing tracks! If you've got good backing tracks with piano &amp; drums or guitar &amp; drums, great! If not, you may be interested in my <a title="Backing Tracks for Bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/backing-tracks-bass">backing tracks packages</a> available. Actually, these packages are much more than just backing tracks, but I let you discover them if that's of interest to you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This series of walking bass lessons show you an easy-to-understand and easy to put into practice method to create walking bass lines.</p>
<p>This is the second part to my 'crash course' in <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/free-video-bass-lessons/walking-bass-lines/">walking bass lines</a>. As I said in the earlier tutorial, there's a lot to learn when it comes to creating good walking bass lines, but these lessons should get you on the right path as fast as possible, so you can start applying these concepts in real playing situations.</p>
<p>In the first video, we talked about using just root, 3rd, 5th and 'passing note' (one semi-tone below or above the first note of the next chord).</p>
<p>We've done that on <em>Autumn Leaves</em>, which is a great tune to start with. If you haven't already done so, you can download the lead sheet I've provided with the <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/walking-bass-lines/walking-bass-crash-course-lesson-1.html">first lesson</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully you've realised that we can create very nice walking bass lines using just these notes, especially if we use all the 3rds, 5ths and octaves available --i.e. above AND below. I recommend you practice just that for a while, exploring the different options available, before moving to the next step.</p>
<p>Done? So... next step! Very simple: we're going to add more chromatic notes, ascending and descending, to add a little bit more diversity to our walking bass lines. And if your <a title="Walking Bass - Improve your Swing Feel" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/rythm/walking-bass-swing-feel.html">swing feel"</a> is good, it should begin to sound the business ;).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These <strong>walking bass lessons</strong> show you an easy-to-understand and easy to put into practice method of creating a walking bass line.</p>
<p>In my younger years, I found myself in an awkward situation where I was asked to play some jazz type <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/free-video-bass-lessons/walking-bass-lines/">walking bass lines</a> for a band I was in... At the time I had NO IDEA how to create a walking bass line, so I had to come up with something fast that to get me out of trouble, keep the band happy and ultimately not get me the sack lol! (Getting the sack would have been even more complicated as the band I was working for was a full time pro band on a cruise ship... I might have got stranded in Barbados!... actually that sounds quite good!).</p>
<p>This is a quick tutorial explaining what walking bass lines are and more importantly how to get 'up and running' with them without having to get into too much theory.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this new bass lesson I'm going to show you a nice lydian jazz lick you can play over a Major 7th chord.</p>
<p>What's interesting about this one, is that there's a sharp 11th in it, which creates the "tension". If something makes you think of the Simpson's, that's because of this very tension note.</p>
<p>If you're not used to hearing 11th (or 4th) played over Major 7 chords, it will probably create… tension in your body, which is the point! But after a time, you'll get used to it and it should be a nice tension.</p>
<p>If you haven't watched my lesson <a title="How to Practice Arpeggios on the Bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">How to learn Arpeggios on the bass</a>, it might be a good idea to do so: in this lesson, I'm showing you how you should learn your arpeggios starting from different fingers --index, major and pinky. Here we're gonna use the "third position" (starting from the pinky).</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the second Jazz phrasing bass lesson in this series.<br />
<span style="font-size: medium;">If you haven't watched the first one, please check it out <a title="Jazz Phrasing Bass Lesson #1" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/jazz-phrasing-video-bass-lesson-1.html">here</a></span></p>
<p>In this lesson we'll go on working with <em>Blue Bossa</em> which is very well-suited for our purposes.</p>
<p>So let's see how we can develop our phrasing on this tune, keeping in mind that all this information is transferable not only to other chords but also to a lot of different tunes.</p>
<p>Want savvy phrasing? What about "intervallic relationships"? If you've never heard it before, don't feel overwhelmed and click the play button! Hopefully, this lesson will make it much clearer…</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I'm gonna be talking about jazz phrasing in the context of bass soloing.</p>
<p>But what is... "phrasing"?</p>
<p>Well, to put it simply, it's just like when you're talking: there's <em>what</em> you say, the words you use, etc. and <em>how</em> you say it --rhythm, intonations, breathing… Have you ever ever been told "It's not what you say! Its HOW you say it!" ;) Have you ever heard a speaker who made you feel drowsy after 30 seconds and another one who kept you all ears during his entire speech?</p>
<p>Same thing with music and soloing, for that matter. Obviously you don't need me to tell you that you can even play the exact same notes and make it sound great or death boring. What I'd like to show you in this series of bass lessons is what you should focus on specifically if you want to improve your soloing skills.</p>
<p>There are many related lessons on this website, but two of them come to my mind right now, that perhaps you should watch, if you haven't already: the first one is about <a title="Letting the Snare Drum Breathe…" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/letting-snare-drum-breathe.html">Letting the snare drum breathe</a>, the second one on <a title="Right Hand Dynamics on Bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-dynamics.html">Right Hand Dynamics</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this new bass lesson, I'm taking you through a lick that we can play over an E minor 7th chord or over its relative major chord which is G Major 7th.</p>
<p>I'll be showing you what triads and <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">arpeggios</a> I'm using, so you're not only learning a new lick but you can also expand on that and build your own lines.</p>
<p>Remember that although learning a ton of licks is better than learning nothing ;), if you understand how a lick is built, you'll be much better equipped to create your owns and, more generally, you'll become a much better musician, not just a "<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/video-bass-lesson-ii-v-i-jazz-lick-2.html">lick player</a>".<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here's another bass lick you can play over major-7th type chords.The <a title="Jazz Lick for M7 Chords #1" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/licks/jazz-lick-major-7th-type-chords-1.html">previous one</a> was built mainly over the C major <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">arpeggio</a>. This one uses quite a few chromatic notes, for a change. Nothing really complicated but watch your fingering!</p>
<p>We'll learn this lick in B flat major but as always, don't hesitate to transpose it in other keys. Also, experiment and see how you could apply it, i.e. what you could play before and after and remember that these bass licks you learn are not supposed to be an end in themselves but rather to be a springboard.</p>
<p>So, again, you've got to understand how they're constructed so you can create your own, putting together various ideas and adding your personal touch / inspiration. Always look at the bigger picture.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you probably know by now, ScottsBassLessons is <em>not just</em> about licks, grooves and chops… What I'm striving to do here is to give you a 'non-reductive' approach to learning and playing the bass.</p>
<p>That said, I'm not '<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/video-bass-lesson-ii-v-i-jazz-lick-1.html">anti-lick</a>' at all! What I'm saying is that it's not <em>enough</em> to learn a ton of bass licks, particularly if you want to be able to play with other musicians. But learning bass licks and grooves is a part of your musical education and you'll benefit even more from learning if you understand how they are constructed, so you can create your owns.</p>
<p>So today I'm going to show you a simple jazz lick for <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/licks/jazz-lick-major-7th-type-chords-1.html">Major 7th</a> type chords. It's built mainly over the C major arpeggio --btw. have you watched my lesson <a title="Practice Arpeggios on the Bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">practicing arpeggios on the bass</a>? When I say it's simple, I mean the way it's constructed is very simple, but make sure you use appropriate fingerings, by copying mine, for example. ;)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here's a new lesson showing you another II-V-I bass lick, this time in the key of Eb. As I said many times before --but I'm saying it again in case you didn't hear it…, once you're comfortable playing a bass lick in one key, stretch yourself a little and practice it in all keys. You won't regret it, as you'll become a <em>much</em> better player doing so!</p>
<p>Within this lick, I use a variety of 'tension notes' to spice things up a little! Tension-Release, Tension-Release… ;)</p>
<p>Again, I highly recommend you practice over backing tracks, <a title="Backing Tracks for Bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/backing-tracks-bass">the ones I have packaged</a> for you or others, but make that a habit, it's <em>really</em> invaluable!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today's bass lesson we're gonna be working on a little II V I Jazz lick (melody) in the key of C Major. The chords are Dm7-G7-C7 and we'll have one bar of each.</p>
<p>Within this lick, I use a chromatic exclosure type lick that sounds really cool, IMHO (btw, you may be interested in my lesson about <a title="Target chord tones chromatically" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/target-chord-tones-chromatically.html">targeting chord tones chromatically</a>).</p>
<p>When you're comfortable playing this lick in the key of C, I highly recommend you practice it in all keys. As I often say, knowing a variety of bass licks helps a lot, but is not enough. Even more so if you know them in ONE key only…</p>
<p>Also try and practice over backing tracks. If you have your own, great! Otherwise, I've found that they are such valuable 'learning aids' that I've made <a title="Backing Tracks for Bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/backing-tracks-bass">special packages for you</a>, all bundled with a thorough video lessons, notation &amp; more.</p>
