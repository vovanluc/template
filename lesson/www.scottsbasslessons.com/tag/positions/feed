<p>You may or may not know but two weeks ago I released a brand new course into the SBL Academy course library... and it's HUGE!</p>
<p>In fact, it's probably the most detailed and in depth course focusing on scales, arpeggios and chord tones in existence, coming in at over 10+ hours long!</p>
<p>This lesson is a sneak preview of a lesson from the new course.</p>
<p>So what's this lesson about?!...</p>
<p>Mapping out your available notes on the fretboard can seem incredibly hard! There's 4 different basic arpeggio types to learn, and with each of the different chord types you need to be able to play them fluidly up and down the fretboard in multiple octaves... and at the same time still be musical and keep the groove. That sounds crazy hard, right?!</p>
<p>Don't worry... I've got a cool trick up my sleeve for ya! :)</p>
<p>For every chord type there is, I've mapped them out using 3 easy to learn one octave shapes. This gives me the ability to play any arpeggio all over the fingerboard without having to memorise huge elaborate patterns by simply linking up the smaller shapes. It also gives me the freedom change direction upon the fingerboard whenever I want so I have complete control over the bass lines or solo lines I'm creating at any given moment.</p>
<p>In this lesson I’m going to show you a few different ways you can play a two octave arpeggio to demonstrate how useful this technique can be.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
</p>
<p>PS. If you enjoy this lesson and really want to become a "scales/arpeggios ninja" on the bass you should check out our 10+ hour  course, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/harmonic-layering-arpeggios-chord-tones-scales" target="_blank">"<em>Harmonic Layering - A Comprehensive Guide To Chord Tones, Arpeggios &amp; Scales"</em></a>.</p>
<p>It's probably the most thorough scales and arpeggio course that's ever been created coming<br />
in at 10+ hours long... I literally take you step by step through everything I know on the<br />
subject, leaving no rock unturned. It's ALL in there.</p>
<p>Within the new course I cover arpeggios, chord tones, scales, pentatonic scales, the modes, uses of more exotic scales, but most importantly - I show you how to use all of these elements to create awesome bass lines, grooves and solos.</p>
<p>​In other words - I not only show you everything I know, I also show you how to actually use this information in <em>real life situations</em>!</p>
<p>In fact the lesson you're about to watch is part of that course! :) Check it out <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/harmonic-layering-arpeggios-chord-tones-scales" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you may know, alongside my online bass lessons -- and when I'm not on a gig marathon... I also give one-on-one coaching. The bass student I met yesterday was a pretty well-rounded "technician" but came to me because he found it difficult to apply all this patiently acquired knowledge in a live situation. Can you relate? If you do, watch this lesson!</p>
<p>I also recommend that you watch my lessons on <a title="How to practice arpeggios on the bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">How to practice arpeggios</a> and <a title="How to Practice Bass Scales" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/practice-bass-scales.html">How to practice scales on the bass</a>, if you haven't already done so, because they also deal with fingerings and concepts I use in this lesson.</p>
<p>Oooh… and did you notice the download link under the video? This backing track is not included in the <a title="" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/backing-tracks-bass">backing tracks packages</a> you can find on my little store. It's very simple but will come in handy when you need to work on a funky groove!</p>
<p>By the way… although I'm trying my best, it's just not humanely possible for me to reply personally by mail, on YouTube and on various forums ;) but I take the opportunity to thank you all so much, Guys, for all the great feedback on these backing tracks packages! I'm really glad you find them so helpful!</p>
