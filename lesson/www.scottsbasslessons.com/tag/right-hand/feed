				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this new bass lesson, I'm talking about <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-and-left-hand-positioning.html">right hand</a> dynamics on the bass. Many bass players or students coming to me, haven't got particularly good dynamics --if any, and it's a very big flaw as we shall see.</p>
<p>Don't worry… looking into my past, I definitely suffered from this as well, which reminded me of a somewhat painful anecdote I'm sharing with you in this video ;).</p>
<p>Basically, having poor dynamics equates to speaking in a monotonous voice: it's a real communication killer! If you want to express something on the bass, you must work on your dynamics. I'm giving you cues and exercises...</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this tutorial I'm talking about right and left hand positioning: I see soooo many players with a terrible hands positioning… they'll probably end up with a RSI --Repeated Strain Injury, which is not cool at all and can keep you away from your bass for weeks or months.</p>
<p>If you haven't seen my <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/beginners/strap-height.html"> tutorial about strap height</a>, please check it out before you watch this video: as you can guess, your strap height will greatly condition your right and left hand positioning. So save yourself from bad habits and injuries and watch <a title="Strap height on bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/beginners/strap-height.html">this video</a> if you haven't and then come back here.</p>
<p>Basically, what you want to avoid is to have an excessive bend in your wrists that would put a lot of strain on your tendons and ultimately cause an injury. Be careful: you might not feel it right from the start, but after hours of playing --not necessarily in a row, believe me, you most certainly would!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this lesson, I'm showing you an octave string skipping exercise for your plucking hand that complements the lesson on <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html">right hand</a> --or plucking hand technique that deals with <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html ">alternate plucking and raking</a> and also the one on <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/bass-right-hand-muting-floating-thumb.html">string muting</a>. If you haven't watched these lessons, please do so before you watch this one: it's mandatory that your plucking/raking/muting be good enough before you practice skipping strings.</p>
<p>The exercises I'm showing you in this video consist of playing octaves up and down and across the neck. The <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-and-left-hand-positioning.html">fretting hand</a> pattern is very simple and easy to memorize so you can concentrate on your plucking hand: it's very important that you play evenly and cleanly.</p>
<p>As always, start slowly and increase the speed as you go, tracking your progress with a metronome. As soon as it becomes "sloppy", decrease the speed --and take a rest if needed, the goal of these exercises is not to kill your wrists ;).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this lesson, I'm talking about "right hand muting". There are various ways to mute the strings with your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html">plucking hand</a> on the bass, and it's important that you know and use at least one of them. If you're not convinced, the first example I give in the video, in which I play a scale <em>without</em> muting any strings should make it pretty obvious! Yes… there's a lot of noise going on and it sounds... horrible!</p>
<p>There are two basic techniques to mute the strings you don't play on the bass:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 'floating thumb' technique --used by guys like Gary Willis, Todd Johnson, etc.</li>
<li>The unnamed technique ;), which consists in muting the unplayed strings with the ring finger and pinky (although I call it 'index' in the video, I meant 'pinky' or 'little finger', sorry!). This technique is used by guys like John Patitucci, Jaco Pastorius, among others.</li>
</ul>
<p>No muting technique is better than the other and there are great players using each of them. Plus, you can use both, depending on the context… A video with nice close-ups should make all that clearer…</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Right hand -- or "plucking hand" technique should I say, in order not to isolate the lefties ;), is too often forgotten about, because many players are so bothered about what they're playing with the other hand...</p>
<p>But right hand technique on the bass is really key for a lot of techniques and for speed, so it's very important that you investigate and practice these right hand techniques.</p>
<p>First of all, when you're ascending a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-scales.html">scale</a> or bass line, you MUST alternate index-middle-index-middle, etc., no excuses! Failing to do so would really be detrimental to your fluidity, precision, speed, etc. I'm expanding on that in the video.</p>
<p>When it comes to descending however, you've got two choices: either alternate picking or raking. None is better than the other but what's important is that, when you've chosen the one that suits you best or feels more natural to you, you stick to it! Another important thing is that you can rake with both the index and the major.</p>
<p>Practice VERY slowly rather than playing too fast and getting into bad habits that would be a pain to break.</p>
