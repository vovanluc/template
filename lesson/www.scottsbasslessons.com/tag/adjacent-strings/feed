				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Slap bass is undoubtably one of the most popular and recognizable techniques when playing bass so I thought it was about time to get our thumbs out for this weeks Bass Riff of The Week!</p>
<p>The key of E is one of the most popular key centers to create slap riffs around as having the open E within the groove means we can player higher up the neck, but still utilize the low E within the riff. This makes it easier than if the root note was G for instance, as if we wanted to incorporate the low G within the riff we'd most probably have to play the majority of the riff in the lower area of the neck.</p>
<p>I've actually recorded a full lesson on this a few months ago called "Breaking The Mould" <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/slap-bass-lesson-breaking-the-mould.html">that you can check out here</a>. If you want to investigate playing slap riffs in other key centers than E.</p>
<p>That said, I still love to create slap <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/slap-bass-lesson-the-sectret-triplet-technique.html">riffs in E </a>but with this weeks riff I've decided to incorporate some double stop type ideas and also some lines that require you to slap and pop on adjacent strings - and this can be quite tricky if you haven't tried this before.</p>
<p>My aim with this riff is to push you out of your comfort zone and show you that even when a slap riff is in the key of E... it can still be challenging and fun to master.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
