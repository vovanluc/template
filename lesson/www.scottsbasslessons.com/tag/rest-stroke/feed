				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just under 10 years ago I'd hit a complete road block in my bass playing. I was working on all the usual stuff - time feel, fingerboard and harmony visualization, chord tones, standards... they were all going well, but the one thing that I just couldn't seem to get together was my <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/build-speed-accuracy-on-the-bass-1.html">SPEED</a>!</p>
<p>Now I know... it's not all about speed, but let's face it - at some point or another pretty much all of us want to tear around the fingerboard like the Paganini of bass!</p>
<p>Well, I just couldn't get it together! When I went over a certain speed my lines just became messy and uncontrollable... and it would be the understatement of the century to say this did not drive me absolutely CRAZY!</p>
<p>So enough was enough, I finally decided something had to change. Something within my technique needed to be tweaked, but I just wasn't sure exactly what it was.</p>
<h3><em><strong>My mission began...</strong></em></h3>
<p>Over a 2-3 month period I focused <em>"only"</em> on my <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique">technique</a>. I know that sounds crazy, but I really needed to get to the bottom of this, and I would not rest until I did!</p>
<p>I'd break up my time working on different exercises - all with a metronome so I could measure my progress and keep track of what was working, and what wasn't. <strong>By the way, if you're not doing this already - start now!</strong> It's one of the BIG things I talk about constantly with the members of <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">The Academy</a>. Keeping track of what you're focusing on is an absolute must!</p>
<p>Anyway, back to my story...</p>
<p>Over the first few weeks I started to notice that if I used a free stroke instead of the traditional rest stroke (don't worry all is explained in the lesson below) I could get a faster response from the note being played, and I also felt like I was gaining more overall control of my plucking hand too. As the practice continued on, I felt more and more comfortable with this technique for playing faster lines, and by the end of the 3 month period I had pretty much completely changed my plucking hand technique.</p>
<p>And, I'm happy to report - I finally began being able to play faster lines!</p>
<p>Now, there are a couple caveats to this story...</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The free stroke <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique">technique</a> is <strong>NOT</strong> for everyone. There are MANY bass players that can play at break neck speed using the rest stroke - you might be one of those guys, and in that case - awesome! The free stroke is not a "silver bullet"... I'd practiced for month upon month using the rest stroke before I switched to using the free stroke. I changed my technique because my original technique wasn't working <em>for me</em> - not because I hadn't put in the hours of practice. Whichever technique you choose - you need to give it a chance before trying something else.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Technique changes will absolutely not happen over night</strong>. You are re-training your brain, and altering brain patterns when doing so. To find out more about how technique changes take place, <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/unhappy-with-your-technique-watch-this-l99.html">go here</a>.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

Please note:</strong> As you may know, most of my lessons come's with a free backing track - as this one <em>"should"</em> too! In the house moving mayhem that's going on right now at my end, the hard-drive with the backing track for this lesson has decided to... well, find a safe place of it's own! ;) As soon as it reveals itself, the backing track will be uploaded! Until then... see you in the shed ;)</p>
