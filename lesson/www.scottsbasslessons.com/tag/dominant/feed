				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Using 10th style chords within my grooves and bass lines is something I've been playing around with lately and it's been great fun! So, I wanted to share it with you and get you using them within your bass lines too.</p>
<p>Before we delve into this weeks riff, I also wanted to share my composition process with you as I get a constant flow of emails asking how I come up with a new riff every week... and, how I'm going to keep coming up with new and original ones every week for the next year (I've vowed to create 52 Bass Riff Of The Week episodes over the next year).</p>
<p>The truth is, I don't just sit and wait for inspiration, that would take too much time... instead, I give myself rules, or at least a set of guide lines. By doing this it gives me the ability to get laser focused on a few different elements and makes the composition process a lot easier.</p>
<p>For instance, a simple set of rules for writing a song could be;</p>
<ul>
<li>It must only contain 3 chords.</li>
<li>The melody line has to be very rhythmical.</li>
<li>The melody line should include large interval jumps.</li>
</ul>
<p>By doing this, it would give the writer something to focus on and narrow down the possible routes they could take. This is a common compositional technique used by many song writers.</p>
<p>My guide lines for this riff were;</p>
<ul>
<li>The riff cannot start on the root of the chord or main key centre.</li>
<li>The riff must contain 10ths.</li>
<li>The riff must be over a funk type groove.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week i’ve been on a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQE5vwlRYHA">Tower of Power</a>” listening marathon so I thought it would be fitting to model this weeks bass riff around a funk feel with a 16th note groove to it.</p>
<p>If you haven’t heard T.O.P before, you need to come and join the party… these guys are one of the funkiest bands on the planet, and happen to have one of the tightest rhythm sections you’ll have ever heard - the one and only Rocco Prestia on bass and David Garibaldi on drums.</p>
<p>To hear Rocco and David in action, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04P5_AGMu3M">check this out</a>.</p>
<p>Ok, let’s look at the riff.</p>
<p>This weeks riff is based around a D dominant 7th sound with a few sneaky chromatic notes added here and there to spice things up a little. If you’re not sure what a “D Dominant 7th” is don’t sweat it, I run through it in this lesson. But as a caveat, if you’re not working on your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">chord tones or arpeggios</a> yet, you’re going to need to start prioritising them within your practice time as they are the harmonic foundation of everything you’ll play as a bass player. They are an essential part of the language, and to get your bass playing to the next level understanding them and being able to use them is a must.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey low-end lovers!</p>
<p>So after the epic comments I got in last weeks "<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/bass-riff-week-1.html">Bass Riff Of The Week #1</a>" lesson where I asked you guys whether you'd like a bass riff <em>every week</em>... I thought i'd better put another lesson together to keep your funk flowing! ;)</p>
<p>This riff is based around the E dominant 7 tonality (E7) and has a few cool chromatic notes thrown in here and there to spice it up a little. Make sure you're practising your chord tones so you can see how this riff fits within your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">basic arpeggio shapes</a>, that way you'll not only be learning this riff, you'll also be learning harmonic information that you'll be able to apply to other dominant chords too.</p>
<p>Again, this lesson is super guerrilla... we just hit record, no fancy lights or fancy audio... just one camera and a mic in the room. We're in the process of moving studios (keep a look out for the new studio video tour coming soon!) so in a few weeks we should be all settled in and have the sexy audio and cameras back up and running! :)</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed!</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. Lemme know what other types of riffs you'd like to hear by leaving a comment below the video. Rock, jazz, funk... even riffs of other famous songs... let me know by leaving a comment! :)<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Want more funk bass lessons?</h3>
<p>I got such a great feedback following the '<a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/funk-bass-lesson-c7-groove.html">Funky Bass Groove in C7</a>' lesson that I decided to make another one, this time on a G7 chord, for a change.</p>
<p>This time we're gonna be grooving and creating a bass line on top of a good old Hammond organ --or 'underneath', rather.</p>
<p>Like in the previous lesson, I'm 'deconstructing' the groove so you can see -- or rather hear all the workings and learn the whole groove section by section. Some parts may take a while to get under your fingers, so practice slowly and get it right before you play them at 'full speed'.</p>
<p>One of the things that make this groove a bit special is that I'm not starting on the root note (here G), but on the flat 7th. When used appropriately, starting on another note than the root note can sound great, provided you respect the harmony, of course.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey funk bass lovers!</p>
<p>In this new funk bass lesson, I'm completely deconstructing a great groove and showing you why it 'works' on a C7 chord (C dominant 7), but the same applies for any dominant chord, of course.</p>
<p>First, remember the arpeggio on a dominant chord is: root-major 3rd-5th-flat 7th.</p>
<p>Second, make sure you lock in with the <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/letting-snare-drum-breathe.html">bass drum</a> when you get the notes right.</p>
<p>Also, I play a lot of dead notes in that groove but don't worry too much about that in the beginning: first concentrate on getting the notes right, then lock in with the drums and you can add the dead notes afterwards --unless you're really comfortable with them.</p>
<p>Btw, if you're not comfortable with playing dead notes --also called 'ghost notes', I've made two bass lessons on the subject:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Ghost Notes on Bass (Part 1)" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/ghost-notes-on-bass-1.html">Ghost Notes on Bass #1</a></li>
<li><a title="Ghost Notes on Bass (Part 2)" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/ghost-notes-on-bass-2.html">Ghost Notes on Bass #2</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I guess I'm saying that all the time but… make sure you work on small sections and get them right before you put them all together, rather than trying to play the whole groove too early… and badly.</p>
<p>Oooh, and most importantly: have fun!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here’s a series of lessons on bass soloing over static dominant chords, which is something I had problems with when I first started soloing --a long time ago!</p>
<p>At the time, I was not aware of or really comfortable with the various substitutions I could use. Therefore, I was kinda ‘stuck’ playing arpeggios, which is better than playing random notes and does sound good, but there’s so much more you can do!</p>
<p>So, what I’m doing in the first lesson is take a C7 chord and start playing only notes contained in the C7 arpeggio because, again, that’s not a <em>bad </em>thing at all, as long as you also know and practice other options available to you. If you haven’t seen my lesson on how to <a title="How to Practice Arpeggios on the Bass" href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">practice arpeggios on the bass</a>, please do so.</p>
<p>When you’re comfortable playing the arpeggio in three different positions, you can start “closing the arpeggio”, i.e. play the notes a semi-tone above and a semi-tone below each note of the arpeggio, which already gives you much more options…</p>
<p>But check out the vids and see some of the numerous options we’ve got to expand our bass solos over static dominant chords.</p>
