				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Muting with the left hand to get a shorter attack from the note and giving your bass lines a more vintage feel, is something I only came across a few years ago.</p>
<p>I originally discovered this technique when watching a video of the great bassist and educator Danny Mo Morris (who's now one of the many world-class educators teaching within the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">SBL Academy</a>), but soon after I saw many bass players using the exact same technique such as the great gospel bass player Sharay Reed and the power house of groove behind the band Tower of Power, Rocco Prestia.</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to show you this cool left hand muting technique in detail, and also tell you how it pretty much saved my bass playing career!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. You can download the play-along track, TAB &amp; notation directly under the video. If you're an <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">SBL Academy member</a> you can also download the full video file so you can watch these lessons offline plus the audio only version too.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this lesson, I'm talking about "right hand muting". There are various ways to mute the strings with your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html">plucking hand</a> on the bass, and it's important that you know and use at least one of them. If you're not convinced, the first example I give in the video, in which I play a scale <em>without</em> muting any strings should make it pretty obvious! Yes… there's a lot of noise going on and it sounds... horrible!</p>
<p>There are two basic techniques to mute the strings you don't play on the bass:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 'floating thumb' technique --used by guys like Gary Willis, Todd Johnson, etc.</li>
<li>The unnamed technique ;), which consists in muting the unplayed strings with the ring finger and pinky (although I call it 'index' in the video, I meant 'pinky' or 'little finger', sorry!). This technique is used by guys like John Patitucci, Jaco Pastorius, among others.</li>
</ul>
<p>No muting technique is better than the other and there are great players using each of them. Plus, you can use both, depending on the context… A video with nice close-ups should make all that clearer…</p>
