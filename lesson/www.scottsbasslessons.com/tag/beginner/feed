<p>Ok, I think you'll be in agreement... Slap bass is simply one of the coolest and funkiest techniques you can use on bass!</p>
<p>Unfortunately for many players it's really hard just to get <em>up and running</em> with this technique and much of this is down to the movement of their slapping arm. More likely than not they're using too much forearm movement and not enough forearm rotation, which is what I believe is the best and easiest way to get that snappy slap sound you associate with bass players such as Larry Graham and Marcus Miller.</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to focus on movement and take you through two great plucking hand exercises will help you get the correct fluidity of movement you'll need to start creating and playing great slap bass lines.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<p>Many of the students that i’ve worked with in the past have had problems with their technique, and in many cases their bad technique was the main thing that was holding them back.</p>
<p>It’s more often than not a mix of many different elements which all feed into each other and put our whole alignment out of balance - bad posture, wrong strap height, wrists that are too bent, over stretching… I could go on and on.</p>
<p>The gag is, each of these things feed each other. If one thing is wrong, it effects everything else and ultimately it holds your bass playing back in a big way.</p>
<p>It’s like trying to run a race, but with a brick tied to one foot and a tennis racket to the other… you’re not going to be going anywhere fast! ;)</p>
<p>In this lesson i’m going to show you some great pointers to keep your technique clean and free of bad habits.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
</p>
<p>PS.
