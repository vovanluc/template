				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok… we all love cool bass riffs, right?!</p>
<p>Well, I had an idea and wanted to run it past you…</p>
<p>As you probably already know, I release one bass lesson per week, <strong>and this will continue (until the end of time!)</strong>… but I’m always thinking about how to give more value and bass-elicous goodies to the SBL posse.</p>
<p>So here’s my question to you…</p>
<p>What do you think about adding in a “Bass Riff of the week” video into my regular lesson schedule?</p>
<p>My regular lessons will carry on as normal, the “riff of the week” would simply be a cool riff for you to get down, and i’d demonstrate it at several different tempos so you can really see and hear what’s going on.</p>
<p>I’d love to here what you think… so make sure you leave a comment below the video.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. Along with the “riff of the week” idea… is there any other types of videos you’d want to see… theory? Gear? Reviews? Interviews? More cool performances of me and my band?… lemme know by leaving a comment! :)<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here's a technique I first heard the legendary bass player Pino Palladino using on D'Angelo's album 'Voodoo'. Then, on closer examination I found that many bass players were using the same technique... <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/teen-town-jaco-pastorius.html">Jaco</a>... even Jimi Hendrix!</p>
<p>Essentially, it's adding chordal type playing within a groove - which can be tough if you don't know exactly how to approach it.</p>
<p>In this bass lesson I'm going to show you how to get it into your bass playing with ease... so you can get FUNKY!</p>
<p>Now, grab you're bass and get in the shed!</p>
<p>Scott. :)</p>
