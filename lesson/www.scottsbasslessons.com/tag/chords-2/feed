				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Using 10th style chords within my grooves and bass lines is something I've been playing around with lately and it's been great fun! So, I wanted to share it with you and get you using them within your bass lines too.</p>
<p>Before we delve into this weeks riff, I also wanted to share my composition process with you as I get a constant flow of emails asking how I come up with a new riff every week... and, how I'm going to keep coming up with new and original ones every week for the next year (I've vowed to create 52 Bass Riff Of The Week episodes over the next year).</p>
<p>The truth is, I don't just sit and wait for inspiration, that would take too much time... instead, I give myself rules, or at least a set of guide lines. By doing this it gives me the ability to get laser focused on a few different elements and makes the composition process a lot easier.</p>
<p>For instance, a simple set of rules for writing a song could be;</p>
<ul>
<li>It must only contain 3 chords.</li>
<li>The melody line has to be very rhythmical.</li>
<li>The melody line should include large interval jumps.</li>
</ul>
<p>By doing this, it would give the writer something to focus on and narrow down the possible routes they could take. This is a common compositional technique used by many song writers.</p>
<p>My guide lines for this riff were;</p>
<ul>
<li>The riff cannot start on the root of the chord or main key centre.</li>
<li>The riff must contain 10ths.</li>
<li>The riff must be over a funk type groove.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here’s a series of lessons on bass soloing over static dominant chords, which is something I had problems with when I first started soloing --a long time ago!</p>
<p>At the time, I was not aware of or really comfortable with the various substitutions I could use. Therefore, I was kinda ‘stuck’ playing arpeggios, which is better than playing random notes and does sound good, but there’s so much more you can do!</p>
<p>So, what I’m doing in the first lesson is take a C7 chord and start playing only notes contained in the C7 arpeggio because, again, that’s not a <em>bad </em>thing at all, as long as you also know and practice other options available to you. If you haven’t seen my lesson on how to <a title="How to Practice Arpeggios on the Bass" href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">practice arpeggios on the bass</a>, please do so.</p>
<p>When you’re comfortable playing the arpeggio in three different positions, you can start “closing the arpeggio”, i.e. play the notes a semi-tone above and a semi-tone below each note of the arpeggio, which already gives you much more options…</p>
<p>But check out the vids and see some of the numerous options we’ve got to expand our bass solos over static dominant chords.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the following bass lessons, I hope to give you some melodic tools that will help you improvise within static chordal grooves and modal tunes like 'So What' and 'Impressions'. There are many ways to approach soloing over static minor chords and modal harmony on the bass. The techniques I have chosen to discuss within the following tutorials have really helped my students break away from playing the same old 'licks' as well as given them the option of playing 'in' and 'out' of the harmony with the correct techniques to do so. Remember, be patient and methodical with your bass practice. Get in the shed and good luck! S.</p>
