				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok, I admit it... I stole this exercise from one of my favourite all time guitar players, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0ZX9EByOuk" target="_blank">Mike Walker</a>.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to study with Mike years ago when I was really just starting out with improvising, and although over a 4 year period I only sat down with him a hand full of times - those lessons were by far the most important lessons I ever had. Ever.</p>
<p>And, yeah - you might think, <em>"but he's a guitar player... and you're a bass player, right?!"</em>...</p>
<p>Here's the deal. Improvisation is improvisation no matter what instrument it's on. If you really want to study improvisation, by only listening to or studying with bass players you're missing out on a huge chunk of the party ;) ...when it comes to improvisation I really recommend studying with as many different instrumentalists as you can - my favourites have been guitar players, piano players, trumpet players and trombone players.</p>
<p>Right, that's enough <em>"Mike love" </em>for now... let's look at this exercise!</p>
<p>If you're <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/unlock-fretboard-must-see-lesson-bass-players.html">playing up and down the neck</a>, whether it's during a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/cuff-scotts-solo-bass-groove.html">bass groove</a>, fill, or solo line, you need to get super focused on exactly how you're shifting through the different positions on the neck. If you don't, you're fingers will literally start tripping over themselves, you'll end up using odd fingering combinations, and the overall result will be messy sounding lines that have no consistency - and for you, it will be a case of <em>"sometimes I can pull it off... and other times it just sounds and feels terrible"</em>...</p>
<p>Well, the 2 exercises I'm going to show you in this lesson will help you completely eradicate this common problem from your bass playing.</p>
<p>All I'll say for now is... it's <em>ALL</em> in the shifting!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the second part of my lessons on building speed and accuracy on the bass. So if you haven't seen the <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/build-speed-accuracy-on-the-bass-1.html">first part</a>...</p>
<p>In the previous lesson, we worked on descending the C <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/beginners/beginning-the-major-scale.html">major scale</a>, breaking it down into chunks of increasing size, adding one note at a time. In this lesson, we're going into the exact same process, but ascending. Again… if you haven't seen and practiced my <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html">lesson on alternate plucking</a>, please do so, otherwise you won't be able to apply what I'm showing you here.</p>
<p>Don't forget that playing fast is a combination of things, among which good plucking/raking technique and economy of movement, both for your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html">plucking hand</a> and fretting hand. Keep your movements as "small" as possible: the farther your finger is away from the string, the longer it takes to reach it. Makes sense? ;)</p>
<p>Again, spend as much time as needed on a 4 or 5 or 6-note chunk, increase the speed gradually, relax, breathe, take rests… Don' worry, speed <strong>will</strong> come with time and practice!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speed… Almost every learning bassist wants to play faster, which is understandable, but don't forget that speed is something you <strong>build</strong> day after day and it mustn't be at the expense of accuracy. Actually, trying to play <em>too</em> fast, i.e. play much faster overnight, can cause mental and physical blocks that will slow down your progress.</p>
<p>So, what can you do to <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/double-your-speed.html"><strong>build</strong> your speed</a>? Break things down, not your tendons! Generally, string crossing is a problem when you're trying to play faster. So, if you haven't seen my lessons about right hand technique, <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html">raking &amp; alternate plucking</a>, <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/octave-string-skipping-right-hand-exercise.html">string skipping (octaves)</a> and <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/bass-right-hand-muting-floating-thumb.html">right hand muting</a>, please do check them out before you try to apply what I'm showing here!</p>
<p>In this lesson, we're going to work on a C major scale, first descending, then ascending, breaking it down into sections which size will increase by one note at a time: 3 notes, then 4 notes, 5 notes, etc. Remember it's not a problem at all if you spend one week playing just five notes! If you want to play (well) faster… take your time!</p>
