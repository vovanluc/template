<p>I’ve seen countless bass players struggling with their <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy/online-bass-courses/technique-deep-dive-bass">technique</a> - they can’t seem to play faster type lines or make big stretches on the fingerboard… in fact stretching any more than 4 frets is a struggle for them.</p>
<p>In most cases <em>bad positioning</em> is at the root of all these problems.</p>
<p>Positioning your bass correctly whilst sitting or standing is absolutely vital. Not only could it hold your bass playing back in ways you may not realise, but even more seriously than that it can effect your health.</p>
<p>In this lesson I’m going to show you some <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy/online-bass-courses/technique-deep-dive-bass">techniques</a> to help you find the perfect bass position.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
</p>
<p>PS. If you enjoy this lesson and really want to become a "technique jedi" on the bass you should check out our full technique course within the <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy" target="_blank">Academy</a>. It’s over 2 hours long and includes the very exercises I developed working with hundreds of students over the years, and ultimately completely changed my bass playing.</p>
