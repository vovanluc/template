<p>You may or may not know but two weeks ago I released a brand new course into the SBL Academy course library... and it's HUGE!</p>
<p>In fact, it's probably the most detailed and in depth course focusing on scales, arpeggios and chord tones in existence, coming in at over 10+ hours long!</p>
<p>This lesson is a sneak preview of a lesson from the new course.</p>
<p>So what's this lesson about?!...</p>
<p>Mapping out your available notes on the fretboard can seem incredibly hard! There's 4 different basic arpeggio types to learn, and with each of the different chord types you need to be able to play them fluidly up and down the fretboard in multiple octaves... and at the same time still be musical and keep the groove. That sounds crazy hard, right?!</p>
<p>Don't worry... I've got a cool trick up my sleeve for ya! :)</p>
<p>For every chord type there is, I've mapped them out using 3 easy to learn one octave shapes. This gives me the ability to play any arpeggio all over the fingerboard without having to memorise huge elaborate patterns by simply linking up the smaller shapes. It also gives me the freedom change direction upon the fingerboard whenever I want so I have complete control over the bass lines or solo lines I'm creating at any given moment.</p>
<p>In this lesson I’m going to show you a few different ways you can play a two octave arpeggio to demonstrate how useful this technique can be.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
</p>
<p>PS. If you enjoy this lesson and really want to become a "scales/arpeggios ninja" on the bass you should check out our 10+ hour  course, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/harmonic-layering-arpeggios-chord-tones-scales" target="_blank">"<em>Harmonic Layering - A Comprehensive Guide To Chord Tones, Arpeggios &amp; Scales"</em></a>.</p>
<p>It's probably the most thorough scales and arpeggio course that's ever been created coming<br />
in at 10+ hours long... I literally take you step by step through everything I know on the<br />
subject, leaving no rock unturned. It's ALL in there.</p>
<p>Within the new course I cover arpeggios, chord tones, scales, pentatonic scales, the modes, uses of more exotic scales, but most importantly - I show you how to use all of these elements to create awesome bass lines, grooves and solos.</p>
<p>​In other words - I not only show you everything I know, I also show you how to actually use this information in <em>real life situations</em>!</p>
<p>In fact the lesson you're about to watch is part of that course! :) Check it out <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/harmonic-layering-arpeggios-chord-tones-scales" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WARNING!... In this bass lesson I'm going to show you a 'KILLER AWESOMESAUCE LICK' to demonstrate how to use the different fingerings of each arpeggio and how this will help you to play over the entire fingerboard... LIKE A BAD ASS!</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered how bass players such as Janek Gwizdala, Gary Willis, John Patitucci and Matt Garrison seem to be able to play bass lines and solos up and down the fingerboard seamlessly?</p>
<p>What's the secret?</p>
<p>They have amazing visualization of harmony on the fingerboard.</p>
<p>The key to mastering your visualization of the fingerboard is knowing three different <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/shape-shifting-chord-changes.html">shapes</a> for each of your fundamental arpeggios and then simply joining them together and playing 'through' the shapes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it can be hard for bass players to understand how to play 'through' the shapes and therefore they keep getting stuck in one area of the neck.</p>
<p>Let's get in the shed!</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
