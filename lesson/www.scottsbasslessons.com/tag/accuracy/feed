				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this weeks "Bass Riff of the Week" i'm getting my thumb out and going Gospel!</p>
<p>Last week during a live Q&amp;A masterclasses that we run bi-weekly within the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/sbl-insider-pro">SBL Academy</a>, one of our members was having problems getting a clean slap technique. He could slap the E string with no problems whatsoever, but as soon as he started slapping the A, D or G strings he started getting unwanted noise as the other strings would ring out uncontrollably. He also found the overall volume of the these strings to be quieter than the E string too.</p>
<p>These are all very common problems and something i'm sure you might have had a problem with either in the past, or it might be something you're struggling with right now. In our live Q&amp;A session I advised him that the best way to start working on these issues was to take a repeated riff that used all the strings, and then simply start working on this riff really slowly over an extended period of time, looking in-depth at each individual movement until it can be played cleanly with the same overall volume on each string.</p>
<p>I thought the bass riff I came up with during our Q&amp;A session was pretty cool... so I thought i'd use it for this weeks "Bass Riff of the Week".</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the second part of my lessons on building speed and accuracy on the bass. So if you haven't seen the <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/build-speed-accuracy-on-the-bass-1.html">first part</a>...</p>
<p>In the previous lesson, we worked on descending the C <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/beginners/beginning-the-major-scale.html">major scale</a>, breaking it down into chunks of increasing size, adding one note at a time. In this lesson, we're going into the exact same process, but ascending. Again… if you haven't seen and practiced my <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html">lesson on alternate plucking</a>, please do so, otherwise you won't be able to apply what I'm showing you here.</p>
<p>Don't forget that playing fast is a combination of things, among which good plucking/raking technique and economy of movement, both for your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html">plucking hand</a> and fretting hand. Keep your movements as "small" as possible: the farther your finger is away from the string, the longer it takes to reach it. Makes sense? ;)</p>
<p>Again, spend as much time as needed on a 4 or 5 or 6-note chunk, increase the speed gradually, relax, breathe, take rests… Don' worry, speed <strong>will</strong> come with time and practice!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speed… Almost every learning bassist wants to play faster, which is understandable, but don't forget that speed is something you <strong>build</strong> day after day and it mustn't be at the expense of accuracy. Actually, trying to play <em>too</em> fast, i.e. play much faster overnight, can cause mental and physical blocks that will slow down your progress.</p>
<p>So, what can you do to <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/double-your-speed.html"><strong>build</strong> your speed</a>? Break things down, not your tendons! Generally, string crossing is a problem when you're trying to play faster. So, if you haven't seen my lessons about right hand technique, <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html">raking &amp; alternate plucking</a>, <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/octave-string-skipping-right-hand-exercise.html">string skipping (octaves)</a> and <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/bass-right-hand-muting-floating-thumb.html">right hand muting</a>, please do check them out before you try to apply what I'm showing here!</p>
<p>In this lesson, we're going to work on a C major scale, first descending, then ascending, breaking it down into sections which size will increase by one note at a time: 3 notes, then 4 notes, 5 notes, etc. Remember it's not a problem at all if you spend one week playing just five notes! If you want to play (well) faster… take your time!</p>
