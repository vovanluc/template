				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this weeks "Bass Riff of the Week" i'm getting my thumb out and going Gospel!</p>
<p>Last week during a live Q&amp;A masterclasses that we run bi-weekly within the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/sbl-insider-pro">SBL Academy</a>, one of our members was having problems getting a clean slap technique. He could slap the E string with no problems whatsoever, but as soon as he started slapping the A, D or G strings he started getting unwanted noise as the other strings would ring out uncontrollably. He also found the overall volume of the these strings to be quieter than the E string too.</p>
<p>These are all very common problems and something i'm sure you might have had a problem with either in the past, or it might be something you're struggling with right now. In our live Q&amp;A session I advised him that the best way to start working on these issues was to take a repeated riff that used all the strings, and then simply start working on this riff really slowly over an extended period of time, looking in-depth at each individual movement until it can be played cleanly with the same overall volume on each string.</p>
<p>I thought the bass riff I came up with during our Q&amp;A session was pretty cool... so I thought i'd use it for this weeks "Bass Riff of the Week".</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For this weeks “Riff of the Week” i’ve used part of the riff from one of my favourite Erykah Badu songs “Annie Don’t Wear No Panties” and then added my own little twist on the end to keep you on your toes ;)</p>
<p>You can hear Erykah’s <a href="http://youtu.be/9d9eydCfTdw">live version here</a> with the awesome Braylon Lacey on bass.</p>
<p>The original riff is based around a C minor tonality with an added 9th which gives it that extra hip sound. The more altered line i’ve added at the end of the riff is based on super imposing a G7 altered chord over the C minor. You can either look at this part of the riff as being derived from the G altered scale, the Ab melodic minor scale or even the Abminor/major 7th arpeggio—as they actually all contain the same notes. This gives the latter part of the riff a strong “out” sound which is commonly heard in jazz improvisation.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed… Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey low-end lovers!</p>
<p>So after the epic comments I got in last weeks "<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/bass-riff-week-1.html">Bass Riff Of The Week #1</a>" lesson where I asked you guys whether you'd like a bass riff <em>every week</em>... I thought i'd better put another lesson together to keep your funk flowing! ;)</p>
<p>This riff is based around the E dominant 7 tonality (E7) and has a few cool chromatic notes thrown in here and there to spice it up a little. Make sure you're practising your chord tones so you can see how this riff fits within your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">basic arpeggio shapes</a>, that way you'll not only be learning this riff, you'll also be learning harmonic information that you'll be able to apply to other dominant chords too.</p>
<p>Again, this lesson is super guerrilla... we just hit record, no fancy lights or fancy audio... just one camera and a mic in the room. We're in the process of moving studios (keep a look out for the new studio video tour coming soon!) so in a few weeks we should be all settled in and have the sexy audio and cameras back up and running! :)</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed!</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. Lemme know what other types of riffs you'd like to hear by leaving a comment below the video. Rock, jazz, funk... even riffs of other famous songs... let me know by leaving a comment! :)<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok… we all love cool bass riffs, right?!</p>
<p>Well, I had an idea and wanted to run it past you…</p>
<p>As you probably already know, I release one bass lesson per week, <strong>and this will continue (until the end of time!)</strong>… but I’m always thinking about how to give more value and bass-elicous goodies to the SBL posse.</p>
<p>So here’s my question to you…</p>
<p>What do you think about adding in a “Bass Riff of the week” video into my regular lesson schedule?</p>
<p>My regular lessons will carry on as normal, the “riff of the week” would simply be a cool riff for you to get down, and i’d demonstrate it at several different tempos so you can really see and hear what’s going on.</p>
<p>I’d love to here what you think… so make sure you leave a comment below the video.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. Along with the “riff of the week” idea… is there any other types of videos you’d want to see… theory? Gear? Reviews? Interviews? More cool performances of me and my band?… lemme know by leaving a comment! :)<br />
