				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The 'sexy' notes...</h3>
<p>First of all, I wanted to say a big thanks to all of you who left such nice comments and spread the word regarding the <a title="Using simple shapes on the bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/shapes-on-bass.html">first part of this bass lesson</a> about using simple shapes. That means a lot to me --and is a real boost when "the going is hard" because I've got sooo much to do! ;)</p>
<p>Next, I want to make it clear that I'm <strong>in no way</strong> suggesting that you shouldn't be thinking notes or intervals! What I'm saying is that it's often simply not possible --if useful to do it all the time while you're playing, and that learning to assign simple shapes to those notes comes in very handy.</p>
<p>In the previous lesson, you've noticed that starting from our little 4-note "boxes" and then putting them all together, we end up with a full Em pentatonic scale. So we <strong>are</strong> learning our bass scales, only in a slightly different way, that many of my bass students find easier. Less "academic", hence less scaryâ€¦ ;)</p>
<p>The other big plus I see in this approach is that it enables us to realise how much we can do with just four notes, before we expand on that.</p>
<p>That being said, in this second part of the lesson, I'm introducing those little 'sexy' notes that have a special 'flavour' to them and sound <em>really</em> good when used properly. Find out what makes you tick! ;)<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My students are definitely an inexhaustible source of ideas for new bass lessons! The previous lesson to this one, <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/internalizing-fingering-positions-on-bass.html">Internalizing fingering positions on bass</a>, followed a private lesson with a student who had a pretty good bass technique but struggled to use it in a live situation...</p>
<p>This one follows a lesson I gave to a professional bass player who really impressed me with his sight-reading skills and overall technical knowledge, but who missed something <em>really</em> important that I'm going to show you in this new bass lesson.</p>
<p>In fact, all his knowledge seemed to rather be a 'hindrance' to him! Let me explain: I'm not telling you that you shouldn't practice to acquire a good musical knowledge and a good bass technique, don't misunderstand me! On the contrary, I highly recommend you <a title="Bass scales practice" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/practice-bass-scales.html">practice your scales</a> and <a title="How to Practice Arpeggios on the Bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">arpeggios</a> on a regular basis, for example. But what I'm saying is that it's not enough to create your own bass lines, to play the bass 'fluently', in a creative way and ultimately without thinking, at least not too much! ;)</p>
