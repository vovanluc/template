<p>The modes can be soooooo confusing!...</p>
<p><em>What are they actually used for?</em></p>
<p><em>Which one should I learn first?</em></p>
<p><em>How can I actually use them to create bass lines, grooves and solos?</em></p>
<p>All of these questions are extremely common... so if they resonate with you - don't worry, you are not alone!</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to show you a great way to learn the ionian mode (major scale) - which is by far the most important scale you'll ever learn, as all of the other diatonic modes are related to this one scale.</p>
<p>I'm going to show you how it relates to major chord types, and three finger patterns that will help you master this scale over the entire fretboard.</p>
<p>Ready?!... ok...</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)<br />
</p>
<p>PS. If you enjoy this lesson and really want to become a "scales/arpeggios ninja" on the bass you should check out our 10+ hour  course, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/harmonic-layering-arpeggios-chord-tones-scales" target="_blank">"<em>Harmonic Layering - A Comprehensive Guide To Chord Tones, Arpeggios &amp; Scales"</em></a>.</p>
<p>Within the new course I cover arpeggios, chord tones, scales, pentatonic scales, the modes, uses of more exotic scales, but most importantly - I show you how to use all of these elements to create awesome bass lines, grooves and solos.</p>
<p>​In other words - I not only show you everything I know, I also show you how to actually use this information in <em>real life situations</em>!</p>
<p>In fact the lesson you're about to watch is part of that course! :) Check it out <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/harmonic-layering-arpeggios-chord-tones-scales" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this bass lesson you're going to learn how to use intervalic shapes and patterns within your bass solos, and how important they can be.</p>
<p>When you listen to a great bass player soloing it can seem effortless, almost like the notes and ideas are just flowing out of them. Well that's true to a certain extent, but there is ALWAYS method behind the madness ;)... everything they're playing within there solo is interval related and I guarantee they'll be either thinking of that while playing, or more likely be 'hearing' that while playing. Either way, there is a thought process behind it. Imagine if you spoke without actual thinking about what you were speaking about about... it'd sound pretty strange wouldn't it! Just random words! Well soloing or simply just playing the bass is just the same - there needs to be some sort of thought process behind it otherwise it would just sound like a random mess of notes.</p>
<p>Using intervallic ideas within your soloing lines can really start to open up the sound and texture of your solos and help you break away from just running up and down scales aimlessly. Getting these types of ideas into your soloing lines is a must, and once you do you'll start to hear that EVERYONE... sax players, piano players, you name it - they use these same techniques!</p>
<p>This lesson will take your bass soloing to the next level!</p>
