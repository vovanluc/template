				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago I released a lesson covering what I refer to as my “<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/fretting-hand-technique-exercise.html">Flying Fingers Exercise</a>”. In a nut shell, it’s a great exercise that’s retrains and refines your fretting hand technique. Which is a must for all bass players!</p>
<p>It went down a storm and was watched over 50,000 times in the first few weeks so I thought it was about time to give you another great exercise I use with my students.</p>
<p>This exercise is focusing on the fretting hand, with a focus on finger independence and controlled movement. As always when working on anything that will be <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/unhappy-with-your-technique-watch-this-l99.html">changing your technique</a> you must start slow and work up the speed of time. When changing your technique you're literally reprogramming your brain to alter the signals it's been sending automatically without thought - so the brain needs time to adjust and relearn the correct movements. To find out more about how your brain literally has a mind of it's own in many ways, particularly when changing your technique, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/unhappy-with-your-technique-watch-this-l99.html">check out this video here</a>.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
