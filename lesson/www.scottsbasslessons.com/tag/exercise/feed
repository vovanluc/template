				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>String skipping is one of those techniques that will constantly trip you up if your technique isn't up to scratch. That's why for this weeks <em>Bass Riff of the Week</em> I've decided to create a riff that incorporates multiple variants of string skipping ideas... essentially so we can get laser focused on this particular movement.</p>
<p>Your aim with this riff should be to get a great feel and overall cleanness while playing the riff, i.e. no strings left un-muted, no strings being caught be accident... but <em>lot's</em> of groove! Once that is achieved you can begin to crank up the speed until you're playing it at the correct tempo with the play-along track.</p>
<p>You can download the play-along track, TAB &amp; notation <strong>directly under the video</strong>.  And, if you’re an SBL Academy member you can also download the full video file so you can watch these lessons offline plus the audio only version too. Not an Academy member yet… <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">check it out here!</a></p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

If you enjoy this lesson and really want to become a "technique ninja" on the bass you should check out our full technique course within the <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy" target="_blank">S.B.L Academy</a>. It’s over 2 hours long and includes the very exercises I developed working with hundreds of students over the years, and ultimately completely changed my bass playing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When practising technique, bass players in general tend to focus on running scales up and down the neck trying to reach that “warp-factor” speed they’ve heard bass players such as Jaco Pastorius, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/notes/gary-willis-bass-clinic.html">Gary Willis</a> and <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/notes/matt-garrison-god-father-of-the-modern-bass-player.html">Matt Garrison</a> achieve.</p>
<p>The big problem with simply running up and down scales to <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy/online-bass-courses/technique-deep-dive-bass">hone your technique</a> is that it’s only focusing on linear type runs. If you dissect and transcribe the bass lines and solos of the greats you’ll find that linear lines are only a tiny part of the bigger picture, in fact these players are using lots of bigger interval leaps within their solos and bass lines.</p>
<p>How do I know this?</p>
<p>Because I made the same mistake.</p>
<p>I practiced scales regularly to build up my speed, but when it came to playing faster lines using arpeggio type shapes across the neck which include much more string crossing type movements my solos started to sound messy and my muting pretty much left the building ;)</p>
<p>So…</p>
<p>I got back in the shed and devised some really great <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy/online-bass-courses/technique-deep-dive-bass">technique exercises</a> that specifically catered for making bigger interval jumps around the neck and focused much more on string crossing than the linear type runs I was practicing before.</p>
<p>It’s not that I was wasting my time by running up and down scales to improve my speed - it was just that I was only focusing on a small fraction of what I needed too.</p>
<p>When I added the new exercises into my practice time the results were great, and I’ve had constant success when using these types of exercises with my students.</p>
<p>In this lesson I’m going to show you one of these exercises so you can add it into your practice time and really start to move around the fretboard freely.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>

<p>Using a plectrum to play bass!...</p>
<p>Surely not?! ;)</p>
<p>Well actually, if you're aiming to be a versatile and in demand bass player you certainly should be able to play bass using a plectrum (also commonly referred to as a pick).</p>
<p>Just as an example of how effective using the plectrum can be when playing bass I recommend checking out Carol Kaye, Bobby Vega, Chris Squire, Steve Swallow and Justin Chancellor. All are phenomenal bass players... and all of them play with a plectrum.</p>
<p>Unfortunately playing bass with a plectrum has a certain stigma attached to it. In the past I've heard crazy statements such as "you're not a real bass player if you play with a pick"... which is completely untrue. In the video below I explain where this stigma has originated from - and why you should completely ignore it.</p>
<p>With many of students I've worked in the past with I've seen constant bad habits and incorrect techniques when using a plectrum. In this lesson I'm going to show you 4 exercises that you can apply straight away to help you clean up your picking technique.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ok, I think you'll be in agreement... Slap bass is simply one of the coolest and funkiest techniques you can use on bass!</p>
<p>Unfortunately for many players it's really hard just to get <em>up and running</em> with this technique and much of this is down to the movement of their slapping arm. More likely than not they're using too much forearm movement and not enough forearm rotation, which is what I believe is the best and easiest way to get that snappy slap sound you associate with bass players such as Larry Graham and Marcus Miller.</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to focus on movement and take you through two great plucking hand exercises will help you get the correct fluidity of movement you'll need to start creating and playing great slap bass lines.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago I released a lesson covering what I refer to as my “<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/fretting-hand-technique-exercise.html">Flying Fingers Exercise</a>”. In a nut shell, it’s a great exercise that’s retrains and refines your fretting hand technique. Which is a must for all bass players!</p>
<p>It went down a storm and was watched over 50,000 times in the first few weeks so I thought it was about time to give you another great exercise I use with my students.</p>
<p>This exercise is focusing on the fretting hand, with a focus on finger independence and controlled movement. As always when working on anything that will be <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/unhappy-with-your-technique-watch-this-l99.html">changing your technique</a> you must start slow and work up the speed of time. When changing your technique you're literally reprogramming your brain to alter the signals it's been sending automatically without thought - so the brain needs time to adjust and relearn the correct movements. To find out more about how your brain literally has a mind of it's own in many ways, particularly when changing your technique, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/unhappy-with-your-technique-watch-this-l99.html">check out this video here</a>.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this bass lesson you're going to learn how to use intervalic shapes and patterns within your bass solos, and how important they can be.</p>
<p>When you listen to a great bass player soloing it can seem effortless, almost like the notes and ideas are just flowing out of them. Well that's true to a certain extent, but there is ALWAYS method behind the madness ;)... everything they're playing within there solo is interval related and I guarantee they'll be either thinking of that while playing, or more likely be 'hearing' that while playing. Either way, there is a thought process behind it. Imagine if you spoke without actual thinking about what you were speaking about about... it'd sound pretty strange wouldn't it! Just random words! Well soloing or simply just playing the bass is just the same - there needs to be some sort of thought process behind it otherwise it would just sound like a random mess of notes.</p>
<p>Using intervallic ideas within your soloing lines can really start to open up the sound and texture of your solos and help you break away from just running up and down scales aimlessly. Getting these types of ideas into your soloing lines is a must, and once you do you'll start to hear that EVERYONE... sax players, piano players, you name it - they use these same techniques!</p>
<p>This lesson will take your bass soloing to the next level!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the second part of my lessons on building speed and accuracy on the bass. So if you haven't seen the <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/build-speed-accuracy-on-the-bass-1.html">first part</a>...</p>
<p>In the previous lesson, we worked on descending the C <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/beginners/beginning-the-major-scale.html">major scale</a>, breaking it down into chunks of increasing size, adding one note at a time. In this lesson, we're going into the exact same process, but ascending. Again… if you haven't seen and practiced my <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html">lesson on alternate plucking</a>, please do so, otherwise you won't be able to apply what I'm showing you here.</p>
<p>Don't forget that playing fast is a combination of things, among which good plucking/raking technique and economy of movement, both for your <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html">plucking hand</a> and fretting hand. Keep your movements as "small" as possible: the farther your finger is away from the string, the longer it takes to reach it. Makes sense? ;)</p>
<p>Again, spend as much time as needed on a 4 or 5 or 6-note chunk, increase the speed gradually, relax, breathe, take rests… Don' worry, speed <strong>will</strong> come with time and practice!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speed… Almost every learning bassist wants to play faster, which is understandable, but don't forget that speed is something you <strong>build</strong> day after day and it mustn't be at the expense of accuracy. Actually, trying to play <em>too</em> fast, i.e. play much faster overnight, can cause mental and physical blocks that will slow down your progress.</p>
<p>So, what can you do to <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/double-your-speed.html"><strong>build</strong> your speed</a>? Break things down, not your tendons! Generally, string crossing is a problem when you're trying to play faster. So, if you haven't seen my lessons about right hand technique, <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html">raking &amp; alternate plucking</a>, <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/octave-string-skipping-right-hand-exercise.html">string skipping (octaves)</a> and <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/bass-right-hand-muting-floating-thumb.html">right hand muting</a>, please do check them out before you try to apply what I'm showing here!</p>
<p>In this lesson, we're going to work on a C major scale, first descending, then ascending, breaking it down into sections which size will increase by one note at a time: 3 notes, then 4 notes, 5 notes, etc. Remember it's not a problem at all if you spend one week playing just five notes! If you want to play (well) faster… take your time!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, I did a tutorial where I showed an exercise for <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/awesome-bass-solo-lesson.html">soloing</a>, where we used only chord tones. I got such a fantastic response to this lesson that I decided to show you another of my favorite chord tone exercises.</p>
<p>This exercise will help you identify where the chord tones are on the neck, and not just the root, 3rd, 5th and 7th always played in sequence. For example we will play 7th-5th-3rd-root and other 'combinations'. It's critical that you take it VERY slowly and make sure you practice each combination over the entire chord sequence. Also, it's very important that you know the chord sequence thoroughly, so that you can concentrate on your neck instead of looking at a piece of paper...</p>
<p>So, for this lesson, we're gonna be working around the first sixteen bars of 'Autumn Leaves', which I used in the previous tutorial. In case you don't have your own copy of '<a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/chord-tones-bass-exercise.html%20">Autumn Leaves</a>', the chords are: Cm7 / F7 / BbM7 / EbM7 / Am7(b5) / D7 / Gm7 / G7. Ready?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this new bass lesson, I'm showing you how to learn &amp; use your <strong>bass scales</strong>, by applying my 'Linear Harmony Concept'. And, most importantly... how to apply them to create music!</p>
<p>Do you know your <a title="Bass Beginner: the Major Scale" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/beginners/beginning-the-major-scale.html">major scales</a>? This is a question i was asked by one of my past tutors. I obviously said yes... and I really believed I did. He then proceeded to give me some major scale exercises that i'm afraid proved me otherwise!</p>
<p>Knowing your major scales and <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">arpeggios</a> in every part of the bass neck in all positions is invaluable and should be practiced daily. The exercises i have given you in the following video tutorials will really open up the geometry of the bass neck and if practiced alongside the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">arpeggio exercises</a> you will truly start to 'see' the available harmony for any given chord sequence all over the bass. By practicing each different fingering of the major scale and then incorporating the continuous scale exercises you will also be practicing them modally as well.</p>
<p>Once you've started to get to grips with these exercises you can start to apply them to different scales. A great way to do this is by applying the exercises over a jazz standard. Begin with easier standards like 'Autumn Leaves' and then when ready progress through to pieces like 'Stella by Starlight'</p>
<p>Take your time and be patient, the continuous scale exercises are tough to start with! Remember, becoming a great musician is a lifetimes worth of study... so enjoy the ride!</p>
<p>Happy shedding, Scott</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This important lesson shows you <strong>how to learn and use arpeggios on the bass</strong>, by applying my 'linear harmony concept' and, most importantly, shows how this concept can actually be applied to other areas of music!</p>
<p>Ok, we've all been told it's imperative for us to practice our arpeggios and <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-scales.html">scales</a> on the bass, but what you might not have been told is that what's incredibly important <em>how</em> you practice them. Running arpeggios up and down the neck is fine, but just doing this will not really have any great effect on your playing.</p>
<p>By practicing them using my 'continuous arpeggio exercises' (explained in the following video tutorials), you will find that chord tones really unlock the mysteries of the fretboard. You'll actually start 'seeing' the chord tones all over the neck which in-turn will stop you having to jump around the fingerboard unnecessarily as you will have whatever harmony you need under your fingers wherever you are on the neck.</p>
<p>As well as transforming the way you 'see' harmony on the neck these exercises are also an amazing ear training tool as well! By applying these exercises to your regular practice time you will start hearing the arpeggios in all there different inversions which in turn will help the development your ear.</p>
<p>These exercises are hard and it will take a lot of practice... but it really will transform your bass playing and your understanding of harmony. Work them into your daily practice routine and you will start to see the benefits. Good luck in the shed! S.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this lesson, I'm showing you an octave string skipping exercise for your plucking hand that complements the lesson on <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html">right hand</a> --or plucking hand technique that deals with <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html ">alternate plucking and raking</a> and also the one on <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/bass-right-hand-muting-floating-thumb.html">string muting</a>. If you haven't watched these lessons, please do so before you watch this one: it's mandatory that your plucking/raking/muting be good enough before you practice skipping strings.</p>
<p>The exercises I'm showing you in this video consist of playing octaves up and down and across the neck. The <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-and-left-hand-positioning.html">fretting hand</a> pattern is very simple and easy to memorize so you can concentrate on your plucking hand: it's very important that you play evenly and cleanly.</p>
<p>As always, start slowly and increase the speed as you go, tracking your progress with a metronome. As soon as it becomes "sloppy", decrease the speed --and take a rest if needed, the goal of these exercises is not to kill your wrists ;).</p>
