				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This new bass lesson deals with legato playing. What is legato playing? It's combining hammer-ons and pull-offs, which implies that to play legato, you first have to master hammer-ons and pull-offs… So if you haven't already, practice that first. This video will show you what they are, in case you don't know.</p>
<p>Legato playing allows you, among other things, to play very fast lines using mostly your fretting hand, the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html">plucking hand</a> being used only to play the first note on each string. A guy like Jeff Berlin uses legato a lot. But we're not going to start with a solo from Jeff's… No sloppy bass playing here! ;)</p>
<p>We're going to start a bit smaller with a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/fast-legato-lines-on-the-bass.html">major scale</a>, making sure we're getting a nice strong attack on every note, equal tempo, and that our notes sound even!</p>
<p>We'll use hammer-ons ascending and pull-offs descending… One note concerning the pull-offs: make sure you don't lift up the strings but rather pull them down. If necessary, experiment a bit with that and it will be pretty obvious that your sound is much better when you pull the strings down. Of course you can use lift-ups too, in another context, but not here.</p>
