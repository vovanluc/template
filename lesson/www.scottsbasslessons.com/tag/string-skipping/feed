				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>String skipping is one of those techniques that will constantly trip you up if your technique isn't up to scratch. That's why for this weeks <em>Bass Riff of the Week</em> I've decided to create a riff that incorporates multiple variants of string skipping ideas... essentially so we can get laser focused on this particular movement.</p>
<p>Your aim with this riff should be to get a great feel and overall cleanness while playing the riff, i.e. no strings left un-muted, no strings being caught be accident... but <em>lot's</em> of groove! Once that is achieved you can begin to crank up the speed until you're playing it at the correct tempo with the play-along track.</p>
<p>You can download the play-along track, TAB &amp; notation <strong>directly under the video</strong>.  And, if you’re an SBL Academy member you can also download the full video file so you can watch these lessons offline plus the audio only version too. Not an Academy member yet… <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">check it out here!</a></p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
</p>
<p>PS. If you enjoy this lesson and really want to become a "technique ninja" on the bass you should check out our full technique course within the <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy" target="_blank">S.B.L Academy</a>. It’s over 2 hours long and includes the very exercises I developed working with hundreds of students over the years, and ultimately completely changed my bass playing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since I started the Bass Riff of the Week series 12 weeks ago I've had loads of requests for a rock style bass riff... so I thought it was about time to get my rocks off ;)</p>
<p>In this lesson you're going to learn about string skipping, my compositional process, and a great way to use the melodic minor scale. Plus you'll learn about why you should watch out for falling branches... don't worry, I reveal everything in the lesson!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this lesson, I'm showing you an octave string skipping exercise for your plucking hand that complements the lesson on <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html">right hand</a> --or plucking hand technique that deals with <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html ">alternate plucking and raking</a> and also the one on <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/bass-right-hand-muting-floating-thumb.html">string muting</a>. If you haven't watched these lessons, please do so before you watch this one: it's mandatory that your plucking/raking/muting be good enough before you practice skipping strings.</p>
<p>The exercises I'm showing you in this video consist of playing octaves up and down and across the neck. The <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-and-left-hand-positioning.html">fretting hand</a> pattern is very simple and easy to memorize so you can concentrate on your plucking hand: it's very important that you play evenly and cleanly.</p>
<p>As always, start slowly and increase the speed as you go, tracking your progress with a metronome. As soon as it becomes "sloppy", decrease the speed --and take a rest if needed, the goal of these exercises is not to kill your wrists ;).</p>
