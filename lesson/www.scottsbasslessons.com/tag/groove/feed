				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For this weeks Bass Riff of the Week I wanted to pay tribute to one of my favorite bass players Pino Palladino.</p>
<p>Within the riff I'm going to show you various "Pino-ism's" so you can start to slip them into your own bass lines and grooves until they become a solid part of your own vocabulary.</p>
<p>We're going be looking at left hand muting, double stops, and much more...</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. You can download the play-along track, TAB &amp; notation directly under the video. If you're an <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">SBL Academy member</a> you can also download the full video file so you can watch these lessons offline plus the audio only version too. Not an Academy member yet... check it out <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy" target="_blank">here!</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As bass players we have many roles to play within a band or ensemble, and creating a strong foundation and groove needs to be high within our priorities.</p>
<p>At times this can mean staying out of the way harmonically, so the rest of the band can do their thing without the bass line getting in anyone's way by being too busy or harmonically rich.</p>
<p>This is great for the rest of the band, but sometimes this can make you feel un-inventive with your bass lines and grooves... in a way, almost like you can't be a part of the creative harmonic process.</p>
<p>Don't worry, you're not alone... until I found a few little tricks (that i'll show you in the lesson below) I felt the exact same way.</p>
<p>But... there's hope! :)</p>
<p>By using specific intervals on certain chord types we can be harmonically creative with our bass lines without the fear of treading on anyone else's toes within the band or ensemble.</p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to take you through which intervals will give you this freedom and the specific chord types they relate too.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For this weeks Bass Riff of the Week I've taken elements from two of my influences - Pino Palladino and <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/notes/matt-garrison-god-father-of-the-modern-bass-player.html">Matt Garrison</a>. Both are phenomenal bass players - both have their own unique style and sound and are completely different from each other.</p>
<p>For this weeks riff I've gone for a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/riff-of-the-week/funk-soul-groove-bass-playing.html">"nu-soul"</a> type vibe which is very reminiscent of the D'Angelo sound that can be heard on his album Voodoo (with Pino Palladino taking care of low-end duties).</p>
<p>The riff is based on a two chord vamp (Dm7-Am7) and other than the double stops the riff is built mostly from chord tones derived from the Am7.</p>
<p>The faster solo line at the end of the riff is built around a C major7#11 chord - I fully explain why this works in the video.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
