				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this weeks "Bass Riff of the Week" i'm getting my thumb out and going Gospel!</p>
<p>Last week during a live Q&amp;A masterclasses that we run bi-weekly within the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/sbl-insider-pro">SBL Academy</a>, one of our members was having problems getting a clean slap technique. He could slap the E string with no problems whatsoever, but as soon as he started slapping the A, D or G strings he started getting unwanted noise as the other strings would ring out uncontrollably. He also found the overall volume of the these strings to be quieter than the E string too.</p>
<p>These are all very common problems and something i'm sure you might have had a problem with either in the past, or it might be something you're struggling with right now. In our live Q&amp;A session I advised him that the best way to start working on these issues was to take a repeated riff that used all the strings, and then simply start working on this riff really slowly over an extended period of time, looking in-depth at each individual movement until it can be played cleanly with the same overall volume on each string.</p>
<p>I thought the bass riff I came up with during our Q&amp;A session was pretty cool... so I thought i'd use it for this weeks "Bass Riff of the Week".</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mixing <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/right-hand-technique-bass.html">plucking</a> and <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/slap-bass-lesson.html">slapping</a> techniques on the bass is something that I rarely see discussed, but is used extensively by many of the worlds top bass players. You’ll have heard it used on many records thousands of times before, most likely without even noticing it as it’s something that can go under the radar so easily even though it’s a huge reason why the bass line sound so damn funky :)</p>
<p>In this lesson I deconstruct the bass line from the famous Jocelyn Brown tune “Somebody Else’s Guy”. This is a perfect example of two different plucking techniques being used in conjunction with each other to give the bass line that “slap bass” feel, but still with the control and tightness of a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/bass-right-hand-muting-floating-thumb.html">finger style bass</a> line.</p>
<p>“Somebody Else’s Guy” was the first song I started using within my practice time to get used to swapping between <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/slap-bass-lesson-the-sectret-triplet-technique.html">slapping</a> and plucking techniques within the same bass line. Initially it’s a lot trickier that you might think as it’s easy to start rushing the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/creating-bass-grooves.html">groove</a> when swapping between the two styles.</p>
<p>Good luck…</p>
<p>And as always, see you in the shed!</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this <strong>slap bass lesson</strong> I'm going to show you a technique that I use a lot. I say 'secret' because it's so hard to see what's going on within slap bass lines sometimess that it's easy to miss the simple little techniques that are thrown into the mix of a groove to give the bass line that super percussive vibe.</p>
<p>Within this tutorial I'm going to peel back the layers of a slap groove and highlight where I'm using these 'secret triplets' to really enhance the overall groove and vibe of the bass line!</p>
<p>Now grab your bass and get in the shed!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok... we ALL like <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/slap-bass-lesson.html">slap bass</a> right?... I'm sure when you first heard your first slap bass riff you thought it was the coolest thing you'd ever heard! Well... me too! But - one thing that so many bass players suffer from is only being able to play slap riffs in the key of E. This happens because we rely way too much on the open E string and tend to get panicked if we have to slap in a different key.</p>
<p>Well in this bass lesson I'm going to show you how to break that mould! With a little hard work you're going to be able to slap in any key!</p>
<p>Now grab you're bass and get in the shed!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can you believe it? A SLAP bass lesson, finally! I've had sooo many e-mails over the last few months asking me to put together a lesson covering slap bass... I've finally given in!</p>
<p>Some of you were even wondering if I had anything against slap bass! I don't, really, and I do have fun with it, occasionally. The only reason I've stayed away from uploading bass lessons on this style, is that I know that bass students can easily get stuck in what I call the "slap bass void": it's fun, it <em>can</em> sound great, you can impress your friends relatively easily... ;)</p>
<p>The risk is that you forget about the rudiments of music, i.e. chord tones, scales, arpeggios, harmony, etc. and never become a well-rounded bass player, able to play with other musicians in a variety of styles --or in any style of music.</p>
<p>And do you think a great slap bass player like, say... Victor Wooten, knows all the stuff I mentioned above? You bet he does!</p>
<p>Now, after these words of caution and wisdom ;), let's slap it!</p>
