				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The 'sexy' notes...</h3>
<p>First of all, I wanted to say a big thanks to all of you who left such nice comments and spread the word regarding the <a title="Using simple shapes on the bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/shapes-on-bass.html">first part of this bass lesson</a> about using simple shapes. That means a lot to me --and is a real boost when "the going is hard" because I've got sooo much to do! ;)</p>
<p>Next, I want to make it clear that I'm <strong>in no way</strong> suggesting that you shouldn't be thinking notes or intervals! What I'm saying is that it's often simply not possible --if useful to do it all the time while you're playing, and that learning to assign simple shapes to those notes comes in very handy.</p>
<p>In the previous lesson, you've noticed that starting from our little 4-note "boxes" and then putting them all together, we end up with a full Em pentatonic scale. So we <strong>are</strong> learning our bass scales, only in a slightly different way, that many of my bass students find easier. Less "academic", hence less scary… ;)</p>
<p>The other big plus I see in this approach is that it enables us to realise how much we can do with just four notes, before we expand on that.</p>
<p>That being said, in this second part of the lesson, I'm introducing those little 'sexy' notes that have a special 'flavour' to them and sound <em>really</em> good when used properly. Find out what makes you tick! ;)<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My students are definitely an inexhaustible source of ideas for new bass lessons! The previous lesson to this one, <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/bass-lines-grooves/internalizing-fingering-positions-on-bass.html">Internalizing fingering positions on bass</a>, followed a private lesson with a student who had a pretty good bass technique but struggled to use it in a live situation...</p>
<p>This one follows a lesson I gave to a professional bass player who really impressed me with his sight-reading skills and overall technical knowledge, but who missed something <em>really</em> important that I'm going to show you in this new bass lesson.</p>
<p>In fact, all his knowledge seemed to rather be a 'hindrance' to him! Let me explain: I'm not telling you that you shouldn't practice to acquire a good musical knowledge and a good bass technique, don't misunderstand me! On the contrary, I highly recommend you <a title="Bass scales practice" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/practice-bass-scales.html">practice your scales</a> and <a title="How to Practice Arpeggios on the Bass" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">arpeggios</a> on a regular basis, for example. But what I'm saying is that it's not enough to create your own bass lines, to play the bass 'fluently', in a creative way and ultimately without thinking, at least not too much! ;)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The legendary bass player Gary Willis is in my opinion one of the most unique bass players out there. He has his own unique approach to the bass guitar, not only in the way he plays but also his sound. He is one of the few bass players that is instantly recognizable when you hear him play.</p>
<p>I was actually lucky enough to study with Gary in Barcelona, and as you can imagine during that time I was 'Willis mad'... transcribing and absorbing everything I could get from him! Throughout all the transcribing and research I carried out, I quickly learned that Gary used the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/using-pentatonic-scales-1.html">pentatonic scale</a> extensively when soloing. In fact the pentatonic scale has a huge part to play in his instantly recognizable sound. Once I had made that discovery I spent several months weaving the pentatonic scale into my vocabulary so I would be able to access the same type of harmonic material he was using. At first I was using it on <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/solo-over-static-dominant-chords.html">static</a> grooves where a one chord vamp would last for an extended period of time, and then later on I was applying it to the jazz standard repertoire where I had to start dealing with multiple key centers and therefore multiple pentatonic scales throughout each piece.</p>
<p>In this tutorial I demonstrate a great lick that is based around the pentatonic scale and is very 'Willis' when played up to speed. It's simply a three note pattern moved throughout the scale. Take it slowly to start with, then start to <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/double-your-speed.html">crank up the speed</a> maybe 10bpm at a time until you reach a speed you're happy with and can play it comfortably.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/using-pentatonic-scales-3.html">previous lesson</a>, I began to talk about learning your pentatonic scales in different positions --on your bass, I mean, not sitting and standing ;). And this is <em>really</em> important because, as with any scale, if you know it in only one position or pattern, you'll get stuck!!!</p>
<p>So you have to learn them starting from different positions / fingers, and I recommend starting with three positions. Let's take the C major pentatonic scale for example: we can start playing it with the second finger on the C, then starting with the fourth finger on the C, and lastly with the second finger on the D.</p>
<p>Once you've learned that patterns, what you wanna do is practice going up in one position then down in another, and vice-versa. Practicing that way will give you a <em>much</em> better mastery of your pentatonic scales and, more generally, of your fretboard!</p>
<p>Btw., this doesn't apply only for the pentatonic scales, it applies for <em>any</em> scale. So if you haven't watched my lesson on <a title="How to Practice Bass Scales" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/practice-bass-scales.html">how to practice bass scales</a>, I highly recommend you do so!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this third lessons about using pentatonic <a title="How to Practice Bass Scales" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/technique/practice-bass-scales.html">scales on the bass</a>, I'm taking another lick that can be played over our chord sequence, which was: A minor / Bb Major / C Major (2 bars).</p>
<p>Actually, it's a <em>really</em> common lick that you've probably heard on several funk records! But still, it sounds good, and, like the previous one, it can be 'dissected' and used in different ways.</p>
<p>But <em>unlike</em> the previous one, that was played in just one position, this one is going across three different positions. It's still a C Major pentatonic scale we're using, but played in different positions on the neck.</p>
<p>I'll do another tutorial talking about learning pentatonic scales in different positions on the bass, but... that's another tutorial. Let's have a look at this second lick first!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is my second lesson in this series about using pentatonic scales in your bass lines.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because of the tonality of these five-note scales, pentatonics are very versatile and can be used in all sorts of ways and styles of music --pop, rock, funk, jazz… you name it.</span></p>
<p>In the <a href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/using-pentatonic-scales-1.html">previous tutorial</a>, we took a very simple chord sequence that goes: A minor / Bb Major / C Major (2 bars) and we've seen that pentatonic scales can sound really cool. After this lesson, I got a lot of emails saying things like 'I kept hearing this kind of melody --or lick… what were you doing exactly there?" etc.</p>
<p>So what I wanna do in this lesson is take one of those pentatonic licks and show you how I 'dissect' it to build other licks, rather than playing the exact same one over and over again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pentatonic scales are widely used in almost every style of music, so much so that they're often called the 'bread and butter' of the bass player!</p>
<p>In this lesson, I'm showing you how you can get pentatonic scales into your bass lines and what they are good for. I'm also discussing how to adapt them, depending on the style of music you're playing.</p>
<p>Basically, a <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/beginners/beginning-the-major-scale.html">major pentatonic scale</a> is very much like the major scale, except it misses out the 4th &amp; the 7th, leaving us with just 5 notes (penta = five). The minor pentatonic scale misses out the 2nd and the 6th and sounds much more bluesy or jazzy.</p>
<p>Then, we'll see how we can use both minor and major pentatonic scales over a simple chord sequence. Have fun! ;)</p>
