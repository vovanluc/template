				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is part 2 of my bass lessons about what I call 'The Gary Willis approach', in which I'm talking about a specific lesson Gary and I went through together when I was studying with him.</p>
<p>If you haven't seen the 1st part of this lesson, please go check it out, otherwise you'll most certainly wonder what on earth I'm talking about!</p>
<p>What we're gonna do is work on substituting major pentatonics on the minor 7th chords, using the standard <em>Blue Bossa</em>.</p>
<p>Translation… The first two bars of Blue Bossa consist of a C minor chord. Over this C minor chord, we're gonna use the first substitution I talked about in part 1, which is the major pentatonic a minor 3rd above the root note of the chord. In this case, the chord being a C minor, we're gonna play an Eb major pentatonic scale.</p>
<p>Then we've got two bars of F minor. So we're gonna do exactly the same and play an Ab major pentatonic scale, etc. 'Etc.' meaning that this stuff looks much more complicated in writing than it is in reality so, if I've managed to whet your appetite and not discourage you, what about watching this long video? ;)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gary Willis has to be one of the most virtuosic, original and unique sounding bass players of the last twenty years. From his early work with Wayne Shorter, the groundbreaking fusion band Tribal tech through to his more recent projects like Triphastic, his bass playing is never less than breathtaking. I was lucky enough to study with him in Barcelona for just over the duration of a year, an experience I will never forget!</p>
<p>Among all the lessons I took with Gary there was one that particularly stood out. In fact it was from this very lesson that all my further lessons with him seemed to be directly connected to. It was almost the foundation of my study with him.</p>
<p>This specific lesson covered the superimposition of major pentatonic scales on top of minor chords and other more complex chord sequences from the jazz standard repertoire. Not only was this eye opening for me, but it also gave me a great insight into why Gary Willis sounds so unique and is instantly recognizable in his soloistic approach.</p>
<p>The superimposition of major pentatonic scales within a soloing/improvisational environment is a large contributing factor to the ‘Gary Willis’ sound. If this is something you want to be able to access and use in your own improvisations I suggest starting with static minor chord vamps to begin with, and then later on when you feel confident doing that move onto more complex chord progressions.</p>
<p>See you in the shed ;)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The legendary bass player Gary Willis is in my opinion one of the most unique bass players out there. He has his own unique approach to the bass guitar, not only in the way he plays but also his sound. He is one of the few bass players that is instantly recognizable when you hear him play.</p>
<p>I was actually lucky enough to study with Gary in Barcelona, and as you can imagine during that time I was 'Willis mad'... transcribing and absorbing everything I could get from him! Throughout all the transcribing and research I carried out, I quickly learned that Gary used the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/using-pentatonic-scales-1.html">pentatonic scale</a> extensively when soloing. In fact the pentatonic scale has a huge part to play in his instantly recognizable sound. Once I had made that discovery I spent several months weaving the pentatonic scale into my vocabulary so I would be able to access the same type of harmonic material he was using. At first I was using it on <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/solo-over-static-dominant-chords.html">static</a> grooves where a one chord vamp would last for an extended period of time, and then later on I was applying it to the jazz standard repertoire where I had to start dealing with multiple key centers and therefore multiple pentatonic scales throughout each piece.</p>
<p>In this tutorial I demonstrate a great lick that is based around the pentatonic scale and is very 'Willis' when played up to speed. It's simply a three note pattern moved throughout the scale. Take it slowly to start with, then start to <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/technique/double-your-speed.html">crank up the speed</a> maybe 10bpm at a time until you reach a speed you're happy with and can play it comfortably.</p>
