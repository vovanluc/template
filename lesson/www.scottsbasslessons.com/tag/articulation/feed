				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So this lesson is a BIGGY!</p>
<p>As in, although I may seem to be covering a pretty simple concept, I believe this is one of the main things that separates great sounding players and mediocre sounding players.</p>
<p>I say “one of the main things” because there are a few different elements that I believe make up a great sounding bass player, and this is just two of them. I should say though, I don’t believe the list is huge… I think there are just a few key things someone needs to master to be a great musician… the gag is, those things, although few, can take a lot of hard work, determination and dedication to master.</p>
<p>Anyway… back to this lesson! ;)</p>
<p>You’ve heard two guys playing the same riff, right? One guy sounds pretty cool… the other guy sounds AMAZING! But, it’s the same riff!</p>
<p>The first time I noticed this phenomenon was in drummers. I’d listen to two drummers playing the same beat… one would sound good, the other would sound amazing.</p>
<p>How is this possible?!…</p>
<p>Three simple things… time feel, articulation and dynamics.</p>
<p>In this lesson I discuss two of these elements, articulation and dynamics and give you some simple exercises to get you going on your journey towards becoming a monster of GROOVE! ;)</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
