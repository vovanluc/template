				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For this "Bass Riff of the Week" I wanted to cover a basic riff, but spice it up by giving it a 6 over 4 feel. Essentially this means although the riff itself isn't overly complex or tough to play, getting the timing and feel correct can be a bit of a pain especially if you haven't played in a 6 over 4 feel before.</p>
<p>The first time I heard this type of feel was while listening to "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teisGt6sv3w">African Skies</a>" by the late great saxophone player Michael Brecker. The track has Dave Holland on upright, Jack DeJohnette on drums, and simply blew my mind when I heard it for the first time! I just couldn't understand why I could count 4, but also count 6 at the same time... this is the first time this concept entered my life, and ever since that moment i've had a deep interest and relationship with it in all it's different forms and permutations.</p>
<p>The gag is, once you start being able to hear this super imposition of 6 over 4 you're going to start hearing everywhere. It's one of the most common time super impositions there is, and by getting it into your toolkit it's really going to give you a deeper and fatter groove across all different time feels - not just 6 over 4.</p>
<p>Oh... and drummers LOVE it too, so whenever they start hinting at it within their groove you can jump on it with them.</p>
<p>To go even further with these types of feels I recommend actually putting your bass down and concentrating on multiple clapping exercises - this gives you the chance to forget about notes for a while and concentrate purely on rhythm. This was HUGE for me. I can't put into words how much this changed my playing...</p>
<p>In fact a few weeks ago in one of the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/sbl-insider-pro">SBL Academy LIVE Q&amp;A sessions</a> I talked about how I discovered this by pure accident and also showed the different clapping exercises I used. That particular Q&amp;A session was over 2 hours long and is in the "bass hang" archive within the Academy. If you haven't checked the SBL Academy out yet... <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/sbl-insider-pro">it's here</a>.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
