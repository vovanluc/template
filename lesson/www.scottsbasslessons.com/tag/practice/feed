				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I talk about a ton of stuff on Scott’s Bass Lessons… chord tones, scales, modes, grooves… the list goes on…</p>
<p>But, all of that is useless if you’re not putting it into practice.</p>
<p>This is why keeping a practice log is HUGE. Seriously…</p>
<p>If I were asked <em>“what’s the one thing moved the needle for you most over the last 25 years of playing the bass”</em> I would reply<em> “The day I started using a practice log”.</em></p>
<p>It gave me the power to completely change my bass playing - and feel like I was in control of it.</p>
<p>That is exactly why we’ve build in a practice log section into the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/sbl-insider-pro">SBL Academy</a>. This is where Academy members keep a detailed log of what they’re working on so they can track exactly what’s working and what’s not, plus everyone can see each others practice logs and discuss the different elements of what they’re doing.</p>
<p>It also adds accountability into your daily bass routine, which is also a “must have” to keep you motivated and driven.</p>
<p>In this lesson I discuss the many reasons you should start using a practice log and give you some of my personal tips on what to include.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this new bass lesson, I'm showing you how to learn &amp; use your <strong>bass scales</strong>, by applying my 'Linear Harmony Concept'. And, most importantly... how to apply them to create music!</p>
<p>Do you know your <a title="Bass Beginner: the Major Scale" href="http://scottsbasslessons.com/beginners/beginning-the-major-scale.html">major scales</a>? This is a question i was asked by one of my past tutors. I obviously said yes... and I really believed I did. He then proceeded to give me some major scale exercises that i'm afraid proved me otherwise!</p>
<p>Knowing your major scales and <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">arpeggios</a> in every part of the bass neck in all positions is invaluable and should be practiced daily. The exercises i have given you in the following video tutorials will really open up the geometry of the bass neck and if practiced alongside the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-arpeggios.html">arpeggio exercises</a> you will truly start to 'see' the available harmony for any given chord sequence all over the bass. By practicing each different fingering of the major scale and then incorporating the continuous scale exercises you will also be practicing them modally as well.</p>
<p>Once you've started to get to grips with these exercises you can start to apply them to different scales. A great way to do this is by applying the exercises over a jazz standard. Begin with easier standards like 'Autumn Leaves' and then when ready progress through to pieces like 'Stella by Starlight'</p>
<p>Take your time and be patient, the continuous scale exercises are tough to start with! Remember, becoming a great musician is a lifetimes worth of study... so enjoy the ride!</p>
<p>Happy shedding, Scott</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This important lesson shows you <strong>how to learn and use arpeggios on the bass</strong>, by applying my 'linear harmony concept' and, most importantly, shows how this concept can actually be applied to other areas of music!</p>
<p>Ok, we've all been told it's imperative for us to practice our arpeggios and <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/improvisation/practice-bass-scales.html">scales</a> on the bass, but what you might not have been told is that what's incredibly important <em>how</em> you practice them. Running arpeggios up and down the neck is fine, but just doing this will not really have any great effect on your playing.</p>
<p>By practicing them using my 'continuous arpeggio exercises' (explained in the following video tutorials), you will find that chord tones really unlock the mysteries of the fretboard. You'll actually start 'seeing' the chord tones all over the neck which in-turn will stop you having to jump around the fingerboard unnecessarily as you will have whatever harmony you need under your fingers wherever you are on the neck.</p>
<p>As well as transforming the way you 'see' harmony on the neck these exercises are also an amazing ear training tool as well! By applying these exercises to your regular practice time you will start hearing the arpeggios in all there different inversions which in turn will help the development your ear.</p>
<p>These exercises are hard and it will take a lot of practice... but it really will transform your bass playing and your understanding of harmony. Work them into your daily practice routine and you will start to see the benefits. Good luck in the shed! S.</p>
