		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, thanks for the great lessons!  I have a question, what is that funky looking acoustic bass sitting in the guitar rack behind you?  Keep up the great work mate.  (Oh and best meal ever for me is Chicken and chips from a chip shop).  
Cheers,
Simon]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cheers scott, thanks for this useful tips and of course for the lessons! I am a not-so-much dedicated bass player (mainly because it&#039;s just a hobby and I have not so much spare time to spend on it), but most of all I noticed I badly need some exercises focused on TIMING. I think I saw a lesson you did some time ago, but there&#039;s probably more. It would be pretty useful if all your lessons had tags - just like in wordpress! - so to make easier for us, looking for something in particular, to find the excercises and tips we are looking for. 
I know that, more than anything, practice makes your timing better, but I&#039;m pretty sure you have some very focused exercise to recommend - just like the &quot;shapes&quot; lesson, I use them a lot!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, what a pleasure to see you on episode 9 again! My question.... and I am sure that this is allready written or discussed 
somewhere on the site but can&#039;t find it: 

How are the rules for uploading videos? How big can one video be (max)? What 
kind of video? jpeg? flv? other? What size for the picture? (I am making my 
videos on Premiere Pro / on Mac) 

Is it possible to insert Youtubelinks instead of uploading the whole thing 
here on Your site? I tried to upload a video  for one of the challanges but I 
couldn&#039;t arrive.... Thanks a lot in advance for further instructions, 
Engel]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, personally, I really like complex harmony (more than sevenths) like the extended chords in Jazz, but I found them really hard to recognize by ear and use them in composing and bass playing. How do you deal with these complex chords?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey scott loved the episode. Little by little I get better understanding of what I was playing on my bass for years. The advantage of starting to playing guitar chords when I was 13 helped me learning the bass. Often after a gig I ask myself how come I can play with the band for hours just knowing the root note and than going on automatic. Sometimes the band gives me a song text with the chords and I then the guitar chords knowledge comes in handy. But I understand now that theory (what where why when how) helps a lot in expanding the expression possebilities. Thanks very much... My favorite meal : Mussels and BELGIAN fries with a sauce of mayonnaise, mustard and a little vinegar. All over the world they call them French fries but  they where invented in Belgium. CU in the shed :o)  Jan  (JanVdK member of the great SBL)]]></description>
