		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, chris here from Malaysia; )
I hav started bass for a few months and I&#039;m wondering what&#039;s the correct strength for the plucking hand to pluck the strings? 

My hands is on a good position regarding to the lessons in sbl website
But my hand still suffers from pain from the palm and the forearm. ...

I want a brighter and shaped tone,so I&#039;ll have to pluck the strings more harder. ..
Or I&#039;ll just need to turn the volume? Mid pot? Bass pot? from the amp?

I can&#039;t play too fast because of this situation. .....pls help!!thanks :)

**for your information:
The plucking technique I use. ..
I will rest my index / middle finger on the strings above the string I plucked. ..
Hope you understand xD]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott.  I have recently purchased a Jim Dunlop Cry baby bass pedal as I wanted to see if I can add some extra funkyness to those &quot;riff of the week&quot; riffs you put out there.  There are guys on youTube that make this look easy.  Having tried it myself I have found that this is a really hard thing to do.  Do you have any tips for using an expression pedal?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,

Is it an idea to create a course in which you go deep in
explaning what different kinda scales you use over a chord.

And explain more about the substitutions you can use and why
they work as there a notes in the different scales that are not in the played
chord.

Also for instance when do you use the different scales
(Melodic Minor or the Harmonic scale)

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, big shout out &#038; Happy Holidays to you and your team, keep up all the great work. This is by far the best bass instructional/informational web site out there, I highly recommend the SBL Academy to everyone.

Are there any tips or exercises to help prevent pulIing the &quot;G&quot; string off the fretboard. I&#039;ve been playing for only 2 years and have defiantly been getting better at preventing this from happening, but I&#039;m always finding myself having to concentrate at making sure I don&#039;t pull down on that &quot;G&quot; string.

Also, with your Bass Riff of the week #10, &quot;Groove, chords, Crazy solo lines...&quot;, I&#039;m having difficulty with those double stops from ringing true. Seems like my finger are too short and I mute the &quot;G&quot; string.  Are there any other drills or tips you can give to keep that &quot;G&quot; string ringing when you hit the notes on the &quot;D&quot; sting.

Thanks again / Cheers,

Mike]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott, 
I have trouble about visualize the entire fingerboard; I really want to make connections between chords and scales in different positions...What exercises do you raccomand me in order to fill up this gap?

Cheers,

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,

Thanks for making these question sessions available to us. I&#039;m at the point where I finally want and can but a better bass amp, my older practice/gigging Ampeg B115 combo stopped working last weekend pushing me finally to pull the trigger on that. I want to but a head-cab combination that sounds great and that hopefully gives me the potential to upgrade/expand in the future. I think I want a 4x10 cab, but I would like to have the option to add more cabinets in the future with the same amp. Can you please talk about 4 ohm vs 8 ohm cabs/amps and how to combine these? What should I be looking for as far as watts, impedance, etc? Also, can you maybe recommend brands and models of different amps that could work? Any direction is greatly appreciated!!

Cheers from Calgary, AB Canada
