		<description><![CDATA[Very nice. Sometimes a great melodic solo is good to hear especially coming from the low end of the music family. I&#039;m looking into making the bass sing or the new term I learned the &quot; Mwah &quot; effect made famous by Jaco Pastorius. I been foolin around with that the best I could. It would probably sound best on a fretless bass, but I&#039;m kinda getting the hang of it, like the pic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,
this is a great arrangement of the song! Is there any chance to get the scores of it??  This would be soooo great! ;-)
Thanks for all your lessons, they&#039;re great! Cheers, Florian from Berlin]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[HI Scott,
I absolutely love this arrangement. Great jazz feel. I had never thought of the bass as a solo instrument until I found your pages.  I mean, of  course you hear the bass &#039;soloing&#039; all the time, but this is completely different. Pushing the boundaries and showcasing the instrument. Keep it up, we love your music man..

Cheers and Best Wishes, Phil Boug Bendigo, Australia.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,


Great stuff over there.  I am learning a bunch of stuff from you and my playing is getting better.  Soon I am going to get enrolled to the Academy, but the only problem is time.  Is there any possibility we can get some kind of score for this piece, Chim Chimeney included of course?  I would love to woodshed on this since its being my favorite thing for many years.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great stuff, Scott! Really enjoying your vids. I take what I&#039;ve learned and test drive it every Sunday at church and on gigs [though I haven&#039;t been playing out as often these days]. I appreciate the simplicity and practicality of your lessons. Looking forward to your chordal lessons. 

Keep grooving,
-Vince]]></description>
