<p>Playing chords on bass can be tricky! In fact right from the start we're at a disadvantage simply because of the low register of the bass.</p>
<p>That said, you can certainly play chords on the bass - and, it can sound <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/notes/christmas-day.html" target="_blank"><em>VERY</em> cool!</a></p>
<p>In this lesson I'm going to teach you about voice leading - what it is, how it can help you gain more freedom on the fretboard, and why we need to start thinking like piano players!</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

<p><strong>1. </strong>What do you personally do to expand your bass line and soloing vocabulary on bass?</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">2. </strong>Scott, can you elaborate on your composition process.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">3. </strong>Did teaching bass improve your own skills in anyway?</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">4. </strong>How about inverting double stops or sliding chords (perhaps in higher positions on the neck?)</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">5. </strong>When and why did you decide to share your knowledge on YouTube? What was/is the personal story behind Scott’s Bass Lessons as a learning platform and when did you recognise that things started happening?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Using 10th style chords within my grooves and bass lines is something I've been playing around with lately and it's been great fun! So, I wanted to share it with you and get you using them within your bass lines too.</p>
<p>Before we delve into this weeks riff, I also wanted to share my composition process with you as I get a constant flow of emails asking how I come up with a new riff every week... and, how I'm going to keep coming up with new and original ones every week for the next year (I've vowed to create 52 Bass Riff Of The Week episodes over the next year).</p>
<p>The truth is, I don't just sit and wait for inspiration, that would take too much time... instead, I give myself rules, or at least a set of guide lines. By doing this it gives me the ability to get laser focused on a few different elements and makes the composition process a lot easier.</p>
<p>For instance, a simple set of rules for writing a song could be;</p>
<ul>
<li>It must only contain 3 chords.</li>
<li>The melody line has to be very rhythmical.</li>
<li>The melody line should include large interval jumps.</li>
</ul>
<p>By doing this, it would give the writer something to focus on and narrow down the possible routes they could take. This is a common compositional technique used by many song writers.</p>
<p>My guide lines for this riff were;</p>
<ul>
<li>The riff cannot start on the root of the chord or main key centre.</li>
<li>The riff must contain 10ths.</li>
<li>The riff must be over a funk type groove.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, see you in the shed...</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What can I say… the response I’ve had from the last two solo bass singles that I released has completely blown me away!</p>
<p>Collectively the two singles have had over 20,000 views in just the last month!…</p>
<p>My mind is blown! :)</p>
<p>Because of the overwhelming feedback i’ve received from you guys, I decided it was about to time to get back in the shed (my favourite place!) and get to work on another solo bass single for you.</p>
<p>This new solo single is based on the song “My Favourite Things” from the Rogers and Hammerstein musical The Sound of Music - although my version is quite different from the original as you’ll find out.</p>
<p>I used my Overwater 5 string signature bass strung E-C, and went direct into the desk.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy this one… let me know what you think in the comments below the video.</p>
<p>As always, see you in the shed…</p>
<p>Scott.</p>
<p>PS. If you haven't check out the last two solo bass singles I release, you can check them out here...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/live-sessions/scotts-solo-bass-sessions-smile-charlie-chaplin.html">Smile.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/live-sessions/scotts-solo-bass-sessions-autumn-leaves.html">Autumn Leaves.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>PPS. I mentioned a few weeks back that I’ve had more emails than I can count asking whether i’d be creating a specific course covering how to play chords on the bass, and how I approach arranging solo bass pieces like the one you’re about to listen too…</p>
<p>The great news is that… YES I AM! :) In fact, the first module is already filmed and is in the editing process as I type. The course will be getting released into the <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy/online-bass-courses">Academy course library</a> in just a few weeks time… so keep a look out! If you’re not already an Academy member - <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">check it out here</a>. It’s AWESOME! :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I received such a great response from my first solo arrangement for bass, <a href="http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/live-sessions/scotts-solo-bass-sessions-smile-charlie-chaplin.html">"Smile"</a> by Charlie Chaplin, that I decided it was time to release another single...</p>
<p>This is my solo rendition of Autumn Leaves by Johnny Mercer.</p>
<p>I'm a huge fan of this song and recommend all my students learn to play it as it's a great way to <em>dip your toe</em> into the world of jazz. Unfortunately because so many students use it as one of their first study pieces it has been labelled as a jazz standard that is only played by beginners, and that's really unfortunate as it's such a beautiful song. This was the reason I picked it as my next solo arrangement - to show that it can be performed in many ways, and is certainly not "just for beginners".</p>
<p>It was recorded on my signature Overwater 5 string, strung E-C, direct into the desk using the neck pickup only.</p>
<p>You can also download this single totally free too. All I ask for in payment is… good karma! But if you really want to help me out, I’d love it if you passed this single on or forwarded a link to this video to anyone you thought might enjoy it!</p>
<p>See you in the shed!</p>
<p>Scott :)</p>
<p>PS. I’ve received a ton of email since the <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/live-sessions/scotts-solo-bass-sessions-smile-charlie-chaplin.html">first single</a> was released asking whether I’d ever be creating a course covering how to play chords on the bass and how to master chordal arrangement. Well… the simple answer is… yes I will!</p>
<p>I’ll be releasing a full course covering chords into <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">The Academy</a> at the end of November. If you’re already an Academy member this course will be added to your membership automatically as soon as it’s released. If you’re not already a member… <a href="https://www.scottsbasslessons.com/bass-academy">shoot over here and check out The Academy</a> for yourself.</p>
